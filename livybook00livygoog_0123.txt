mole gesserat bella, ut non quietior populus domi esset
quam militiae fuisset. Nam et muro lapide0, cuius exor- 6
dium operis Sabino bello turbatum erat, urbem, qua
nondum munierat, cingere parat, et infima urbis loca
circa forum aliasque interiectas collibus convalleS, quia
ex planis locis haud facile evehebant aquaS, cloacis fasti-

peace was greater than the effort he
had made in wan—quietior: as
