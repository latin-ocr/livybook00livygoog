express modifications which really belong to the verb is not
uncommon: eg„ serae immtgraverint, Prae-sl 1 1 3 adeo mitem
praebuisse, I. 4. 6.

j. Nouns are used in apposition to express attributive ideas:
e.g., pastor accola eius loci, Ι. 7. 5 3 exsule advena, Ι. 34. 5.

k. Participles take the place of clauses more frequently in
Livy than in other writers: eg„ concursu pastorum trepidantium
circa advenam manifestae reum caedis, Ι. 7. 9 3 haec eum haud
falso memorantem ingenti consensu populus Romanus regnare
iussit, Ι. 35. 6.

l. The perfect participle is often used without any feeling of
tense : e.g., pater moritur uxore gravida relicta, Ι. 34. 2 ; rebus
suis Lavinium translatis civitate cessit, 11. 2. 103 caesum, ΙΙ.
36. 1 n.

n‘t. The use of the gerund or gerundive, especially in the
ablative *of manner, becomes a mannetism almost: eg„ agere
varie rogando alternis suadendoque, II. 2. 93 miscendo con-
silium precesque, II. 9. 1.

n. Shorthand expressionS, with an attribute of any kind,
taking the place of a descriptive clause: eg„ factio haud dubia
regis, I. 35. 6.

o. Livy has also his favorite derivatives and turns of phrase:
as adjectives in -bundus,· nunquam alias ante ,· cf. adeo (see b,
above), and parentheses with enim.

p. A form of speech not really strange to the language is
frequent, wherein a quality is summed up in an abstract, and
made the main feature of an expression ε e.g., adversus tanti belli
terrorem, I. 2. 4 3 foeditate spectaculi, Ι. 28. 1 1 3 concient mira-
culo rei novae atque indignitate homines, Ι. 59. 3.

q. The use of the neuter singular of adJectives and pro-
nounS, either alone or with a partitive genitive, apparently a
colloquial usage, becomes more frequent, but not yet so common
as in later writers: e.g., ex infimo, Ι. 9. 3 ; quidquid civium, Ι.
25. 1 3 pro indignissimo, Ι. 40. 2 3 quidquid deorum, 11. 49. 7 3
ullius, ΙΙ. 59. 8.
