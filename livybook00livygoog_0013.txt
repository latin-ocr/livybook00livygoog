of events, Even the ordinary evidence in documents and the
like had perished before critical skill had been developed to
make use of them. In the place of true history had sprung
up fables, legends, and falsified traditions, sometimes the natu·
ral outgrowth of popular imagination, and sometimes of family
pride or political partisanship. The most important events in
the‘ history of the Roman constitution were enveloped in a
cloud of inconsistent traditionS, wild guesses of ancient writerS,
and deliberate lies.

3. To ascertain the exact truth amid all this falsehood by
careful investigation, Livy had neither the ability nor perhaps
the desire. If a fable was not too absurd on its face for his
contemporaries to credit, it might stand, sometimes with a'word

parentage of Romulus, Ι. 4. 2 ς the story of Acca Larentia, Ι. 4. 7 3
and Livy's own wordS, V. 21. 9, ‘ sed in rebus tam antiquis si
quae similia veri sint pro veris accipiantur, satis habeam ').
If contradictions and inconsistencies were not too glaring, they
could be lightly glossed over, or avoided by omission (see the
story of AscaniuS, I. 3), so as not to be apparent in the con-
tinuous narrative.

EARLY HISTORY os· Roma.

4. No doubt, as in all traditionS, there is a germ of truth
somewhere in these stories relating to the founding and earliest
history of Rome. But what it is and where it is, is as difficult
to find as the woman’s leaven in the three measures of meal
aster the whole was leavened. The site of the city appears to
have been the home of shepherds that pastured their flocks
on the Campagna. The Romans thought these shepherds
came from Alba, and referred their Latin customs to that city
as their origin. They clearly were of Latin stock, and may
have come from Alba as well as anywhere. But that they as
such founded any Rome, with or without a RomuluS, seems
