Romani Albanique ruptor. Audeat deinde talia alius,
nisi in hunc insigne iam documentum mortalibus deder0.'

Centuriones armati Mettium circumsistunt. Rex
cetera, ut orsus erat, peragit: ‘Quod bonum faustum
felixque sit populo Romano ac mihi vobisque, Albani,
populum omnem Albanum Romam traducere in animo
est, civitatem dare plebi, primores in patres legere, unam
urbem, unam rem publicam facere. Vt ex uno quondam
in duos populos divisa Albana res est, sic nunc in unum
redeat.' Ad haec Albana pubes inermis ab armatis
saepta, in variis voluntatibus communi tamen metu co-
gente, silentium tenet. Tum Tullus ‘ Metti F ufeti,’
inquit ‘si ipse discere posses fidem ac foedera servare,
vivo tibi ea disciplina a me adhibita esset 3 nunc, quo-
niam tuum insanabile ingenium est, at tu tuo supplicio

contriver (to whom we owe this 8. inermis: notice the usual
war), Mettius the breaker of the stroke-by-stroke picture, all the

solemn treaty between Rome and
Alba. —audeat: not merely will
dare, but, let some other dare ,· i.e.
‘ if 1 do not take the proper meas·
ures to maintain discipline, 1 have
no reason to object in case some
one disobeys'; but at the same time
the remark is almost an impreca-
tion. -- iam, soon ,· cf. note on
audeat. — insigne documentum:
i.e. a signal example, a conspicuous
warning. There is a confusion of
thought here. By inflicting a pun·
ishment (which is not said) upon
Mettius (in hunc), a warning
will be given (which is what is
said).

7. circumsistunt z i.e. at this point
they come foi-ward and take him pris·
oner. —— quod bonum, etc.: cf. 1.
—urbem: local: rem publicam:
political. — ex uno: in allusion to
the colonization of Rome from Alba.

tory. —variis, etc.: i.e. some ap·
proved and some did not, but all
were alike afraid.

9. posses: for tense, see Gr.
308. a. —vivot emphatic ; i.e. in·
stead of killing, I should have kept
you alive and taught you. — ea
disciplina: tle. a course of instruc·
tion in that branch3 if he could
leam, Tullus would have tried to
teach him. —nunc, but now, as the
case is. -tuum: emphatic, as op-
posed to the humanum genus. —
insanabile, past all cure ‚· refer·
ring to discere, above.- at: the
antithesis is, though you can’t be
cured yourself, yet you can be of
use as an example to the rest of the
world. —- tu, tuo: continuing the
emphasis on tuum, above. — ea:
i.e. the rights of treaties and the
like. - sancta: and therefore in·
