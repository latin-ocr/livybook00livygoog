tamen maximum eius operum fuit tutela per omne regni
tempus haud minor pacis quam regni.

Ita duo deinceps reges, alius alia via, ille bello hic 6
pace, civitatem auxerunt3 Romulus septem et triginta
regnavit annos Numa tres et quadraginta. Cum valida
tum temperata et belli et pacis artibus erat civitaS.

Numae morte ad interregnum res rediit. Inde Tullum 22

Hostilium, nepotem Hostili, cuius in infima arce clara
pugna adversus Sabinos fuerat, regem populus iussit 3

Egeria—quod . . . essent: the
ground of Numa’s action assigned
by himself, and given in a slightly
different tone; cf. velut in the pre-
ceding line.

4. soli: i.e. apparently the only
one of that sort of divinities, ab·
straet qualitieS‚ such as became
very common in Rome later; cf. 27.
7. — sacrarium: the shrine, which
was in the Capitol.—flamines:
those mentioned in 20. 2 ; see note.
—bigis, etc.: i.e. a two-horse cov-
ered carriage. — tutandam: this
reason is no doubt the attempted
explanation of an old custom. —
etiam: tle. not only in shrine and
altar, but also on the person, where-
by, when a promise was made by
elasping handS‚ as was usual, it
would be as sacred as if made in
a temple or the like.

5. faciendis: see Gr. 299- b;
an old construction mostly anti·
quated. -— quae: contrary to the

usual rule, hoc opus, hic labor est:
see Gr. 195. d. — Argeos: these
were six chapels sor local worship
in each of the four regions of the
city. There is good reason to be·
lieve that Greeks had been buried
alive under them. In later times
after their origin was forgotten their
place seems to have been taken by
the shrines of the Lares Compitales.
Local arrangements for public wor-
ship somewhat like parish churches
were regular with the Romans.—
pontifices, etc.: as these matters
had long gone out of use, they were a
matter of antiquity known only to the
pontifices. -· tutela, mainlenance.

6. temperata, well organized,·
properly, regulated by a suitable
mixture3 cs. 18. 4.

22. interregnum: cf. ¹⁷: 57-
pugna: see 12. 2.—- iussit: in
its technical meaning of elected.
