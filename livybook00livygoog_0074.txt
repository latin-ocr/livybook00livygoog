aetatis fuisset, quae fama in SabinOS‚ aut quo linguae
commercio quemquam ad cupiditatem discendi excivisset,
quove praesidio unus per tot gentes dissonas sermone
moribusque pervenisset ? Suop'fe igitur ingenio tempera-
tum animum virtutibus fuisse opinor magiS‚ instructum-
que non tam peregrinis artibus quam disciplina taetrica
ac tristi veterum Sabinorum, quo genere nullum quon-
dam incorruptius fuit.

Audito nomine Numae patres Romani, quamquam
inclinari opes ad Sabinos rege inde sumpto videbantur,
tamen neque se quisquam nec factionis suae alium nec
denique patrum aut civium quemquam praeferre illi viro
ausi, ad unum omnes Numae Pompilio regnum deferen-
dum decernunt. AccituS, sicut Romulus augurato urbe
condenda regnum adeptus est, de se quoque deos consuli
Inde ab augure, cui deinde honoris ergo publi-

there was no chance to hear about
him at Cures, even if he had lived
at the same time3 3. The difference
of language; 4 The impossibility
of a journey to those cities through

the ascetic Sabines. — genere, race.

5. audito: the beginning of the
chapter implies that his name was
mentioned in connection with the
throne as a man eminent in the nec-

 

barbarous tribea, without community
of language or customs with the
Sabines. — fama: sc. adlata esset,
which is naturally implied in the con·
text. - excivisset: sc. fama. It
would need some knowledge of
Greek to arouse a barbarian to de·
sire to hear a Greek philosopher.
4. ingenio, native powers. -——
temperatum, developea ‚· properly,
compoundecl, so as by its different
ingredients to make a fine and
noble nature. — opinor magis,
I fancy, rather. — instructum,
trained ‚· properly, ficrnz'slzed. — ar-
tibus, learning ,· properly, courses os
instruction, particularly philosophy,
as theoretical. — disciplina, mode
oslifi ,· the practical training accord-
ing to the strict puritanic rules of

essary qualifications—patres ε Livy
thinks of them as only Romans. —
inclinari: almost equal to a future3
but the meaning of the verb allows
the present to be used with rege
sumpto as a future protasis. See Gr.
292. — inde: i.e. from the Sabines3
see Gr. 207 a.—patrum aut ci-
vium: here opposed as nobles and

commons. — illi vii-0, this great -

man. — ad unum, unanimously. —-
decernunt: Livy represents the
senate as choosing the king, other
writers make the people elect him.
Cf. Cic. Rep. ΙΙ. ¹3· 25.

6. sicut, just as. — augurato:
see Gr. 255 c. —- urbe condenda,
at tlte building of tlte city ,· a loose
use of the ablative of manner. See
Gr. 301 and examples. — cui de·
