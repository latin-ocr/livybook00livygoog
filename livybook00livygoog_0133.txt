confusion is probably Livy’s own,
who, writing so long after, may
easily have counted the unclassed
citizens as one century, which in
respect to the army they were not.
—accensi: originally enrolled m ad-
dition, but later used as a name for
attendants on magistrates. Here, if
the theory given above is adopted, it
must be taken in its original sense,
but as a noun. — cornicines ε ‘ play·
ers on the horn ' ‚· originally literally
so; later a bronze instrument of a
crooked shape was used, the proper
trumpet of the cavalry. —, tubi·
eines: players on the (straight)
trumpet, the proper instrument of
the foot. - tres: to make this num·
ber correct, we must suppose some
such mistake as above suggested,
making three extra centuries of or·
derlies and musicians.

8. milibus: ablative of price.—
hoc: ire. than the eleven thousand.
—censusx a short-hand form sor
the roll of those having such an
amount of property.—inde: i.e.
ex eis. — immunis: only those who
had a stake in the country were
supposed to make good soldiers or
to be fit to vote—militia: abla-
tive os separation. The more reg·
ular construction would be geni·
tive. — ornato: loosely used, not

of actual but of regulated equip-
ment. —- primoribus, leading men ,·
apparently chosen arbitrarily, though
they would naturally be from the
first class. —duodecimz apparently
Servius, wishing to increase the cav-
alryas well as the votes of the better
class, with true Roman conservatism,
did not disturb the old equites, as
they had been originally instituted
from noble families, but merely doub-
led their number, and enrolled twelve
other centuries not necessarily from
the nobles.

9. sex aliaS, etc.: these were, no
doubt, the original equites, which
Servius did not venture to disturb-
They were always distinguished
afterwards as the sex su rag-ia. --
tribus, etc.- ablative a lute. —
isdem: the names had a religious
character and could not be dis-
turbed. The centuries were called
priores, posteriores, with the origi·
nal designation; cf. 36. 8.—nomi·
nibus: see 13. 8.—dena milia:
the aes equestre, whence the knights
were called equites equo publico. —
ex publico: i.e. from the treasury.
-quibus: loosely construed with
bina milia. —viduaet unmarried
women of fortune, who thus paid
their share os the common bur-
