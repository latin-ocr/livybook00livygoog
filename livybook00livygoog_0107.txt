Inde et civibus otii cupidis et finitimis civitatibus

Igitur Latini, curn quibus Tullo regnante ictum foedus 3
erat, sustulerant animos et, cum incursionem in agrum ·
Romanurn fecissent, repetentibus res Romanis superbe

sacella et aras acturum esse regnum rati.

them up so that all could read

pleased with the hope. — mores,
character ,· instituta, methods of
government.

3· foedus: not mentioned by
Livy.— sustulerant: the pluper-
fect only represents that they had
come to this state of ‚mind before
the time of reddunt. This use of
the tense is very common, to
avoid the monotony of a catalogue
of events in the perfect, with imper·
fects for description. A new point
of departure is taken, and the inter-
vening time is suggested by the
pluperfect3 cf. consalutaverat, 7.
1 n. — superbe: i.e. arrogantly
refusing satisfaction. — desidem:
not a mere attributive‚ but a pred·

icative adj„ takingthe place of an
adverbial phrase.

4. medium: i.e. but the Roman
king was not what the Latins thought
him: though not a Romulus, he was
by no means a Numa. — memor,

reminding one of — novo: i.e. un- ι

used to the restraints of law as yet.
— etiam: sc. credebat ,· the two rea-
sons given are, first, the undesirable·
ness of peace in his time compared
with the reign of Numa; and second,
the impossibility of having it in his
own case without suffering outrage
from without. — quod: relative.

- temptari patientiam: iae. that'

the neighboring peoples had been
trying the Romans' patience, seeing
how much they would stand, and
finding they would bear much, they
regarded this long-suffering with con-
tempt: an explanation of haud . . .
habitururn. - temporaque, and
any way, etc.; a generalizing of the
particulars preceding. — Tullo, a
Tullus.
