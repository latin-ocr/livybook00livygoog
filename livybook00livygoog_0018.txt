9. ‘ Livy’s Pictured Page ' is a just summary of the character
of his works. His style is that of the Augustan age, a little
removed from the rigid formalism of Ciceronian Latin3 but it
is never turgid, affected, nor strained. If we had not already
adopted Cicero as the only model, and decided that other
writers are less pure, we might well set Livy in that place, and
call Cicero and Caesar antiquated.

The peculiarities of Livy’s style, as they affect the beginner,
are mostly such as arise from the nature of his work and its
purpose. Some, however, belong to the change which was
going on in the language generally, and many are at the same
time of both classes.

a. As the work deals with matters recorded in earlier annal-
istS, archaisms are often apparently copied from his sourceS,
either intentionally or accidentally, it is hard to say which:
eg„ exstgnata, Ι. 20. 5 3 ausim, Praef. 1 3 haud with all parts of
speech3 alliteration, as in I. 16. 3 3 and many others·

The lively and vivid representation to the imagination of
events in their progress which was Livy’s aim produces several
effects on his style:

b. A tendency to dramatize, which brings in many words
and constructions of common speech, and causes a na‘ivete' of
statement adapted to the speakers and actors themselves: eg„
viden tu puerum hunc? Ι. 39. 3 3 flexit viam Brutus (sense-
rat enim adventum), I. 60. 1 (here the reason, instead of
being formally made subordinate, takes the colloquial form of
parenthesis) 3 id mirum quantum p'rofuit, ΙΙ. 1. 1 1 3 ent’mvero
non ultra contumeliam pati Romanus posse, II. 45. 11 3 velle
ne scirem ipsi fecerunt, ΙΙ. 45. 12. Here belongs also the fre-
quent use of adea, introducing an explanation of what goes
before (see I. 9. 53 Ι. 10. 7).

c. A rapid flow of narrative, which causes many breaks in
construction, constructiones ad sensum, omissions of connec-
