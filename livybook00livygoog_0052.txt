LIVY.

[Boox Ι.

Iam res Romana adeo erat valida ut cuilibet finitima-
rum civitatium bello par esset, sed penuria mulierum
hominis aetatem duratura magnitudo erat, quippe quibus
nec domi spes prolis nec cum finitimis conubia essent.
2 Tum ex consilio patrum Romulus legatos circa vicinas
gentes misit qui societatem conubiumque novo populo
3 peterent ε urbes quoque, ut cetera, ex infimo nasci ; dein,
quas sua virtus ac dii iuvent, magnas opes sibi magnum-
4 que nomen facere; satis scire origini Romanae et deos
adfuisse et non defuturam virtutem: proinde ne grava-
rentur homines cum hominibus sanguinem ac genus

miscere.

Nusquam benigne legatio audita est, adeo simul sper-
nebant, simul tantam in medio crescentem molem sibi

ac posteris suis metuebant.

A plerisque rogitantibus

dimissi, ecquod feminis quoque asylum aperuissent: id

9. iam, by this time. —hominis
aetatem, only one generativa.—
quibus: referring to the persons
implied in res Romana. -domi:
because there were so few Roman
women.—c0nubia, raght of inter·
marriage, a relation which seems
to have been carefully guarded
among the ancients3 cf. the struggle
later between plebeians and patri·
crans.

2. ex consilio: Livy conceives
the proceeding as it would be under
a consul later. — circa, around
among,· a very common use of the
word in Livy.—societatem: not
necessarily for any other purpose
than the conubium, for even that
would require a treaty of alliance.

3. urbes, etc. z the learner must not
forget the ease with which the Latin
drops into indirect discourse when-
ever anything is to be quoted. The

apologetic tone here is on account
of the youth of the state (novo
populo). It was young, to be sure,
but had a great future before it.

4. deos, etc.: referring chiasti-
cally to virtus and dii. —proinde z
the regular illative particle before
any exhortation, summing up the rea·
sons for the request or command. -
homines, etc. : an additional reason,
through an intimation of equality.

5. adeo, to such a degre'e (as is
indicated by the preceding); a very
common trick of language in Livy,
giving the reason in the form of an
antecedent to a result clause, as if it
were, ‘to such a degree did they,
etc., that they nowhere received
them.’ — spernebant, etc.: i.e.
they scorned them, and at the same
time didn't wish to perpetuate them.
—ecquod, etc.: a question imply·
ing a recommendation, as one might
say, ⁶ have you tried this means? ’ —-
feminis: of course, a most insult-
