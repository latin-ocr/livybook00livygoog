res dedier mihi exposc0, tum patriae compotem me num-

quam siris esse.'

Haec cum fines suprascandit‚ haec 8

quicumque ei primus vir obvius fuerit, haec portam in·
gredienS, haec forum ingressus paucis verbis carminis

concipiendique iuris iurandi mutatis peragit.

deduntur quos exposcit, diebus tribus et triginta—tot

enim sollemnes sunt—peractis bellum ita indicit : ‘ Audi, 10

Iuppiter, et tu, Iun0, Quirine, diique omnes caelesteS,
vosque terrestres vosque inferni audite! Ego vos testor
populum '—illum quicumque est nominat—‘iniustum

esse neque ius persolvere.

Sed de istis rebus in patria

maiores natu consulemus quo pacto ius nostrum adipi-

scamus.

Cum iis nuntius Romam ad* consulendum redit.
Confestim· rex his ferme verbis patres consulebat: ‘ Qua- 11

rum rerum litium causarum condixit pater patratus
populi Romani Quiritium patri patrato Priscorum Lati-

cursion. Later, any form of satisfac-
tion was expressed by res. — dedier :
archaic use of the infinitive after
verbs of asking. - compotem: a
false swearer would be excommuni-
cated, as it were, and cease to be a
citizen. — siris: ‘archaic shorter
form for siveris. The perfect subj.
is very common in such phrases,
especially with negatives.

8. quicumque: sc. apud eum.
—- carminis : cf. 26. 6 n. - concipi-
endi: an antique use of the gerun-
dive, apparently retaining something
of its simple present passive partici-
ple sense, as in iurandi following.
It refers to the set form of oath, as
in conceptis verbis.

9. sollemnes, regular, i.e. pre·
scribed by the rit'ual. — indicit:
this is the religious declaration of
war, in accordance with a previ-
ous vote of the people3 the real
one is made by the senate, as
in 12.

10. ius persolvere: i.e. per-
form its just obligations in mak-
ing reparation. — sed: but I will
not decide, 1 will consult at home.
—maiores natu: tle. the senate:
originally a counsel of elders. —
pacto‚.manner, as regularly in col-
loquial language. — adipiscamur:
see Gr. 334. b. —- cum iis, with
these words.

11. quarum: sc. de eis with cen·
ses. Cf. Gr. 200. — rerum, etc.:
genitive after condixit, in an anti·
quated, uncertain construction, ap-
parently analogous to the genitive
of crime and penalty. — rerum:
i.e. quae repetuntur ,· litium, mat·
ters in dispute: causarum: used,
as in later times, of the subject of
dispute more abstractly, just as we
say ‘the cause of the poor.' — con·
dixit, confhrred but with the idea
of a formal demand, as in the civil
law the same word is used of the
plaintiff. - pater patratus: cf.
