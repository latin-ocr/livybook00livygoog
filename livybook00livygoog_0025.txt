built or building,· the first referring

to the accounts of the immediate ·

founders ; the second, to the adven·
tures of AEneas and their conse·
quences. F or construction, see Gr.
292 a, 300, and cf. inter bibendum

Georg. 111. 206. The construction is
no doubt an old one retained in collo·
quial use. - decora, becoming. —

untrustworthiness. ——monumentiffi

adfirmare. refellere: not merely
qffirm and deny, but establish and
attempt to resute.

is an indulgence not denied to early
times to invent such myths, and so
they are ‘justifiable‚ whether we
believe them or not. ¹·— ut. .·fa
