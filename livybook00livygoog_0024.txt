3 rudem vetustatem superaturos credunt. Vtcumque erit,
iuvabit tamen rerum gestarum memoriae principis terra-
rum populi pro virili parte et ipsum consuluisse, et si in
tanta scriptorum turba mea fama in obscuro sit, nobilitate

septingentesimum annum repetatur et quae ab exiguis
profecta initiis eo creverit, ut iam magnitudine laboret

3. utcumque erit: i.e. whether
1 succeed or not.—iuvabit (sc. me),
I shall be glad .· notice the emphatic
position.—pro virili parte . . . eon-
suluisse‚ to have done my part
also, etc. The expression seems to
come from military or official usage
(cf. viritim), referring to the pro·
portion that belongs to a single man
out of a body. — ipsum: the me has
already been implied with iuvabit.

in obscuro: this use of the neu-
ter adjective instead of a simple
predicate or an abstract noun is
characteristic of the later writers.

nobilitate ae magnitudine,
firme and greatness ,· not definitely
used of any particular quality, but
indicating that they were conspicu-
ous and distinguished men like Fa-
bius, Cato, Caesar, Varro, —officient,
obscure: i.e. not that he himself is
necessarily so small that he isn’t seen
in the crowd, but that they are so great
that he couldn't expect to be seen.

4. res: emphatic, opposed to
scriptorum3 the subject, too, is one,

etc.; another consideration which
prevents him from being sure of
success.
septingentesimum: i.e. from
Ehe founding of Rome, supposed to
e 754 B.C.
repetatur, is (to be treated
from, etc.; always with t e idea of
going back to get something. For
mood, see Gr. 320. e. N. 1.
exiguis ε of course, the state
being small, its history must be
limited in abundance of material.
Livy's mind wavers between the size
of the state and the mass of histori-
cal material,— a thaumatropic view
to which he is all the more tempted
by the fact that res may mean
either the state or the material.—
laboret, threatens to sall.
et legentium: loosely opposed
to operis3 difficult for the writers,
and unsatisfactory to the readers.
Livy has in his mind chiefly the
earlier history, though not that alone.
Cf. a primordio, 1 ; supra sept. an·
num, and primae, 43 prisca illa, 5.
The participle, though rare in the
singular, is in the best writers not un·
common in the plural, as a noun of
agency, and is used still more freely
by Livy and later writers.
haee: i.e. of our own time. —-
quibus: the deeds and the his-
