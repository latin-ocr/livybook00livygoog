native city: the fatherland of the
ancients was their city. η conden-
dae urbis: the dative might have
been used, depending on the verbal
idea—sedem, locum z referring to
domo profugos and to patria chi-
astically. Itis of the greatest assist-
ance to remember‚ in reading Latin,
that it is a very formal lan uage, and
proceeds by antitheses an ideas reg-
ularly matched‚ not always in exact
form, but always in substance. The
best way to be sure what a Latin ex-
pression means is to see what it is op·
posed to. -ν nobilitatem, the fame,-
τῖε. as being the well-known Tro·
jans and AEneas. —animmm their
spirit, as shown by their conduct, in-
trepid, but not malicious nor savage.

religious ceremonies (ictum). - sa·

salve, salutem dicere.

is evidently connected with penes,
penitus, penus, so that they repre·
sent the gods of the inner family
life of the Romans.

10. ea res: the marriage—uti-
que, fully ,· properly, at any rate,
however doubtful the hope might
have been before, but implying
that there was some. —adfirmat‚
confirmed,· the original meaning,
for which usually confirmo is used.
-·- stabili, permanent, likely to
last (objective); certa, secure,
about which they had no dis·
trust (subjective). The Latin is
very fond of presenting the two
sides or phases of an idea in a way
that seems to us tautological.

11. Lavinium: the name of the
woman is probably made up from
the name of the town3 see Introduc·
tion, 4. —breviz often thus without
tempore. — stirpis: a longer form,
retaining theoriginal i. —quoquez
i.e. an heir to the line as well as a
founder of it.—novo: in reference
to the earlier marriage of AEneas, see
Aeneid, passim, where this son is
assigned to the first marriage3 cf.
