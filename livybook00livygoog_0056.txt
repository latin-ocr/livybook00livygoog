LIVY.

docet vanam sine viribus iram esse.

[Boox Ι.

Exercitum fundit

fugatque, fusum persequitur, regem in proelio obtrun-
cat et spoliat, duce hostium occiso urbem primo impetu

capit.

Inde exercitu victore reducto ipse, cum factis vir
magnificus tum factorum ostentator haud minor, spolia
ducis hostium caesi suspensa fabricato ad id apte ferculo
gerens in Capitolium escendit, ibique ea cum ad quercum
pastoribus sacram deposuisset, simul cum dono designa-

vit templo Iovis finis cognomenque addidit de0.

‘ Iuppi·

ter Feretri,' inquit ‘haec tibi victor Romulus rex regia
arma fero templumque his regionibuS, quas modo animo

metatus sum, dedico sedem opimis spoliis, quae regibus

exercitum, etc.: notice the three
moments in the narrative, the army,
the king, and the city. ——regemz
named Acron, according to Prop-
V. 10. 7.

Tm: spon». OP1MA.

5. victore, in triumph ,· not
merely ‘victorious army,' but like
‘ flushed with victory,' as a predicate.
—facti8, etc.: i.e. no less fond of

ι displaying his exploits than great in

performing them—ferculo: such
hand-barrows were used later in the
triumphal procession, to which this
has a certain resemblance, though
Livy ascribes the first triumph to
Tarquinius (38. 3). — Capitolium:
the Capitoline Hm, then unoccu·
pied; cf. pastoribus, in next line.
—pastoribus: i.e. held sacred by
them to Jupiter.—deposuisset:
τῖε. deposited as an offering, doubt-
less hanging the arms on the tree-
— simul, etc: i.e. he offered the
gift. and at the same time conceived
the idea of a temple, for which, in
the manner of augurs, he marked
out by some visible objects the

sacred limits. Only such an augu-
rally consecrated place could be a
templum.

cognomen: like the saints in
more·1nodern times, the ancient di·
vinities were worshipped in many
places and under many relations,
and in these several circumstances
they were considered in a manner as
separate divinities, receiving names
accordingly.

6. Feretri: the story seems to
have been invented, or at least
explained, to account for this
name, which, however, is not very
well accounted for thereby. lt is
true that fi’retrum, from which
Feretrius might come, does mean
barrow,· but the instrument in this
use is too iiisigniticant to suggest
the name sor the divinity. The same
instrument was used for carrying
images in procession, and in that
use might very well give the name.
-rex regia: these two circum-
stances were the necessary requi·
sites for the spolia opima.

animo: later the augur marked
out the space in the sky with the
