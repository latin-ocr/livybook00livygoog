Panaca] LIVY.

in cognitione rerum salubre ac frugiferum, omnis te
exempli documenta in inlustri posita monumento intueri,
inde tibi tuaeque rei publicae quod imitere capiaS, inde
foedum inceptu, foedum exitu quod vites.

Ceterum aut me amor negotii suscepti fallit, aut nulla
umquam res publica nec maior nec sanctior nec bonis
exemplis ditior fuit, nec in quam civitatem tam serae
avaritia luxuriaque immigraverint, nec ubi tantus ac tam
diu paupertati ac parsimoniae honos fuerit3 adeo quanto
rerum minus, tanto minus cupiditatis erat. Nuper divi·
tiae avaritiam et abundantes voluptates desiderium per
luxum atque libidinem pereundi perdendique omnia in-

thing. — cognitione rerum, the
stuajr qs history, as we should call
it.—ornnis te, etc.= the emphasis
gives the force: ⁸ Every example
should have a personal application,
getting force from the conspicuous·
ness of the case where it occurs.'—
tibi, etc. (continuing the emphasis
of te): i.e. personally and politi·
cally (rei publicae).

inde . . . inde: the clauses are
rather loosely opposed. It is only
in a free sense that capias can be
used of foedum. It would rather
correspond to vites; but this is
made to correspond to imitere.
Stin the turn, or, if we like, zeugma,
is not unnatural, as capias takes
the place of something like notes.

form of asseveration, where the first
