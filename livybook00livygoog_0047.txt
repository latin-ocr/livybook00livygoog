mugissent, reddita inclusarum ex spelunca boum vox
Herculem convertit. Quem cum ad speluncam vadentem
Cacus vi prohibere conatus esset, ictus clava fidem pas·

Euander tum ea profugus ex Peloponneso auctoritate 8
magis quam imperio regebat loca, venerabilis vir mira-
culo litterarum, rei novae inter rudes artium homineS,
venerabilior divinitate credita Carmentae matriS, quam
fatiloquam ante Sibyllae in Italiam adventum miratae
eae gentes fuerant. Is tum Euander concursu pastorum 9

of writing, which evidently came to
the Latius by way of Cumae, an
AEolic colony.

venerabilior: tle. the power of
writing seemed divine, but still more

companions. This is a good ex·
ample of the manner in which
in Latin, and especially by Livy,
one stroke is added after another
to complete the statement, and

each with reference to what has
just preceded. The only way to
read Latin is to take it as it
comeS, and often a sentence must
be broken up in translating, in
order to keep the proper inter·
dependence of the parts. — inclu-
sarum: sc. in spelunca. - ex
spelunca: sc. reddita; the whole
is a very common short-hand form
of expression.—convertit, drew
the attention of —fidem: the regu·
lar cry of one calling upon his com·
panions or countrymen or the gods
for assistance, and common in the
comedy (Ofidem popularium, etc.) ;
here inserted to give a more strik-
ing picture.

8. Euander: cf. Virg. Aen. VIII.
51. seq.—Peloponneso: i.e. from
Arcadia. — auctoritate, personal
influence, from respect for his
character. —imperio‚ power, as a
recognized monarch. — miraculo:
i.e. as an apparently miraculous in·
vention.—1itterarum: i.e. the art

so did the famed origin of Evander.
—Carrnentaez derived from car·
men on account of the metrical form
of prophecy, and the supposed di·
vine inspiration os poetry; an Italian
nymph whose name is preserved in
the Porta Carmentalis at the foot of
the capitol. There seems to be
nothing strange to Livy in an Italian
nymph being the mother of a resu-
gee from Arcadia ; but the names
are doubtless all inventions. Prob-
ably the traditional mother of Evan-
der was identified with this Latin
prophetess; cf. Aen. VIII. 3393 Ov.
F. 1. 499. — fatiloquam: in appo-
sition with quam. -Sibyllaez cs.
Aen. VI. 9, seq.

9, pastorum: cf. 7. — trepi-

around Hercules», not venturing to
arrest him, but holding him at bay.

act of open murder. — ampliorem ε
