ut foris bella gererent.

this word, akin to calare, but prob·
ably borrowed from Greek κλῆσις
(rhoicis), must have originally re-
ferred to the calling· out of troops,
as the militia is called to arms (cf.
legio), whence its constant use for
army and fleetr But at the time of
the Servian Constitution, its mean·
ing must have changed, so* that it
came to express the different divis-
ions according to pro erty.-—cen·
turias: this word a o doubtless
changed its meaning at this time,
and came to be used of divisions
irrespective of numbers—hunc:
i.e. the one given in the following.
— ordinem, scale ,· the order in
which rights and duties were given,
according to the assessment already
made. - paci: as giving dignity

48. centum milium: these
numbers can hardly be the origi·

nal ratingsj for, first, these depended

of copper, the original as, but upon
the later reduced value. — aeris:
equal to assium ,· here probably
reckoned of the value of one-tenth
of a denarius (15 to 20 ets). The
fortune of the first class would there-
fore be about two thousand dollars
of our money. — censum, ortum,-
an almost technical use of t e word;
properly, rating. — confecit, he
made up. — centurias: here not a
definite number, but a division of
the class, whatever number it hap-
pened to be. — seniorum: from
sorty-five to sixty. — iuniorum:
from seventeen to forty-five.

2. omnes: i.e. both seniors and

juniors. — ad urbis„ etc. : the whole

was especially a military institution,
although used also for other pur—
poses. - essent: depending on
confecit. — imperata: they were
obliged to provide their own equip-
ment; this sense of requisition is
undoubtedly the original one of im·
pera—galea: a leather cap with
metal mountings. —- clipeum (here
neuter): the round sbield like that
carried by Greek warriors. -— tegu-
menta corporis: i.e. defensive
armor, opposed to tela.—que et:
for et . . . et, as often in Livy; cf. 11.
