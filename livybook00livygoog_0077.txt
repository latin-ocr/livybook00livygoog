Egeria congressus nocturnos esse, eius se monitu, quae
acceptissima diis essent, sacra instituere, sacerdotes
suos cuique deorum praeficere.

Atque omnium primum ad cursus lunae in duodecim ⁶
menses discribit annum, quem, quia tricenos dies singu-
lis mensibus luna non explet desuntque dies solido ann0,
qui solstitiali circumagitur orbe, intercalariis mensibus
interponendis ita dispensavit ut vicesimo anno ad metam
eandem solis, unde orsi essent, plenis omnium annorum
spatiis dies congruerent. Idem nefastos dies fastosque 7
fecit, quia aliquando nihil cum populo agi utile futurum
erat.

Tum sacerdotibus creandis animum adiecit, quam-2⁰

disbelief in the legends is expressly

nymph, one of the Camenae.

6. omnium primum: the im·
portance of this as a religious mat·
- ter comes from the fact that the

festivals depended on it. — ad cur· ,

sus lunae: i.e. the months were
regulated by the moon, but the
solat year is arranged by some other
means—tricenos: the mean lunar
period is eleven hours fifty-six min-
utes short of thirty days, and a year
of twelve such months lacks about
eleven days of the solar year. Even
thirty days to a month does not give
quite a fun year. — solstitiali, etc.:
i.e. the year as it brings the sun
back to the sontica—intercalariis
mensibus: the Romans inserted
months instead of days to regulate
the calendar. — vicesimo: Livy
probably has in his mind the cycle
of Meton of nineteen years, in which
the sun came back to the same sign
of the zodiac from which it started
at the beginning. The whole story
is no doubt one manufactured in
later times. — metam, etc.: i.e. the

solstice would come at the same
date—plenis spatiis: i.e. the time
of the nineteen (or twenty) solar
years would be exactly filled out by
the months.

7. nefastos: τῖε. properly days
when it is nefas to hold courts. Livy
here refers to days when it was not
permitted to hold meetings. These
were really different from the un·
lawsul court days, but perhaps not
made so until later than this time.
—uti1e, convenient, i.e. for the king
and the nobles. The Roman relig-

ion was in later times a very conve· ⁸

nient political weapon.

20. sacerdotibus: there were
two classes of religious function-
aries at Rome, — special priests
of particular divinities (flamines)
and general supervisors of relig-
ious matters ( pontifices). There
was also a rex sacrificulus es-
tablished after the overthrow of
the kings. All religious observances
of great antiquity were ascribed to
Numa, but some of them evidently
