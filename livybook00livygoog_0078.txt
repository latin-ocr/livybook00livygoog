[Boox Ι.

quam ipse plurima sacra obibat, ea maxime quae nunc

Sed quia in civitate

bellicosa plures Romuli quam Numae similes 'reges ’
putabat fore iturosque ipsos ad bella, ne sacra regiae
vicis· desererentur, flaminem Iovi adsiduum sacerdotem
creavit insignique eum veste et curuli regia sella ador-

navit.

Huic duos flamines adiecit, Marti unum, alterum

Quirin03 virginesque Vestae legit, Alba oriundum sacer-
dotium et genti conditoris haud alienum. Iis, ut adsiduae
templi antistites essent, stipendium de publico statuit,
virginitate aliisque caerimoniis venerabiles ac sanctas

fecit.

Salios item duodecim Marti Gradivo legit tunicaeque
pictae insigne dedit et super tunicam aeneum pectori
tegumen caelestiaque arma, quae ancilia appellantur,

belonged to the earliest customs of
the Latin race. —‚ipse: no doubt,
as in all kingdoms of patriarchal
origin, the king, as head of the
elan, could perform sacrifices. Cs.
the rex sacrificulus. —ea maxime,
etc.: these are assigned to the king
as being the most venerable rites in
the state. — Dialem flaminem:
the official title of the special priest
of Jupiter. He was the most ven·

constant attendance: so much so
that he could not leave the city to
be gone over night.—veste: he
wore the toga praetexta, and a pe·
culiar felt cap with a little cone
(apex) and a fillet os wool on the
top. His life was also surrounded

by a great number of religious re·
strictions. See Gell. X. 15.

3. virgines: these nans, origi-

in 'a community where it could not
easily be obtained, became later
an important body in the Roman
religion. Their convent has lately
been excavated at Rome. —Albaz
though Numa is called the founder
os the institution, yet, as Romulus
was said to be a son of one of
the virgins, it was necessary to
account· for this seeming discrep-
ancy. They no doubt go back to
the age of savagery. -— virginitate,
chastioijt. — castimonii& observ·
ames, — venerabile& reverend. —
sanctas, inviolable, as under the
protection of religion.

4. Gradivo: the gods were wor-
shipped in various phases and at
various places in such a way that
one deity was often multiplied into
