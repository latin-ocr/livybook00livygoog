history of the Roman people down to the death of DrusuS,
9 B.c., and probably was intended to be continued to the death
of AugustuS. There were originally one hundred and forty-two
books· These were divided into series of fives and tenS, each
series embracing some marked epoch of history. Thus, at the
beginning of the sixth book, he sayS, ‘ Quae ab condita urbe
Roma ad captam eandem urbem Romani gessere . . . quinque
libris exposui! The first ten books describe events to the es·
tablishment of Roman supremacy in Italy, at the end of the
Second Samnite War. The twenty-first begins with the Second
Punic War, and seventy·one to eighty embraced the Social War.
This division is not systemati'cally carried out, but in later times
the “ Decades of Livy '' has become a common expression. ’
Of this great work we have preserved the first decade, the
third and fourth, and part of the fifth (i.e. five bookS, two of
which, however, the forty·first and forty-third, are incomplete),
—in all thirgy-five. All the rest, one hundred and seven books,
have been lost. Of the “ Lost DecadeS,'' epitomes (periochae)
by an unknown hand, which have been preserved, give a meagre
account of the contentS. The title of the work seems to have
been Ab Vrbe Condita Libri, though Livy himself once (XLIII.
13. 1) speaks of the books as Annales, and Pliny the Elder
(N. H. Praef. 16) calls them ffi'storiae.

2. Livy was not in our modern sense a historian. He was
a rhetorician, who, with honesty, patriotism, and moral fervor,
devoted himself to setting forth the received account of Roman
history in a manner that should be interesting, instructive, and
elevating. Of law, politiCS, religion, and tactics he had no
special knowledge, even as they were in his own day, much
less as they were in the early times of which he writeS. Of the

events narrated in his earlier bookS, especially in the two in
this volume, historic truth was then and still is unattainable.

There was in most cases absolutely no contemporaneous record
