Latinorum, cum quibus publice privatimque hospitia
amicitiasque de industria iunxerat. Saepe iterando
eadem perpulit tandem ut Romae fanum Dia⁸nae populi

3 Latini cum populo Romano facerent. Ea erat confessio
caput rerum Romam esse, de quo totiens armis certa·
tum fuerat.

Id quamquam omissum iam ex omnium cura Latino-
rum ob rem totiens infeliciter temptatam armis videba-
tur, uni se ex Sabinis fors dare visa est privato consilio

4 imperii reciperandi. Bos in Sabinis nata cuidam patri
familiae dicitur miranda magnitudine ac specie. Fixa
per multas aetates cornua in vestibulo templi Dianae

5 monumentum ei fuere miraculo, Habita, ut erat, res
prodigii loco est, et cecinere vate5‚ cuius civitatis eam

should express by ⁸ religious union '
or ⁸ united worship.'— publice, etc. ε
in the absence of organized inter-
national relations in ancient times,
their place was supplied by special
treaties of hospitium, i.e. a relation
under which citizens of a state

(publice), or individuals with their.

families (privatim), were guaran-
teed friendly reception‚ protection,
and comity generally within the
territories or at the houses of sor·
eigners. This relation differed from
amicitia, in that it did not imply
any personal friendship. The words
may be translated by qfficial and
personal friendshz'p5. — Romae:
opposed to Ephesus.

3. ea (see Gr. 195. d): i.e. the
building of the sanctuary at Rome. —-
de quo: i.e. the question answered
in eaput rerum, etc. —fueratz see
Gr. 291. b. R. —idz the same ques·
tion referred to by de quo.--om·
nium Latinorum: opposed to
uni ex Sabinis—eura, etc.: ⁸ dis-
missed from the minds of all the
Latius: a short-hand expression, in·

stead of ⁸ dismissed from their minds
by‚’ etc.— se: the emphasis antici·
pates the emphasis of privato. The
artificial (perhaps rather artistic)
order of the Latin enables it to,
express such shades of emphasis
with extreme delicacy‚ and in this
art Livy is a master. —imperii re·
ciperandi: the same thing, under
a varied aspect, as de quo and id.
4. patri familiae, householder ,-
(avoid the ridiculous ‘father of a
family,’ which in this passage is
a stock school-jest). — fixa, etc.= a
parenthetical remark illustrating the
character of the creature. — vesti-
bulo: this word, of most uncertain
use and meaning, can here only
refer to the prostyle, or portic0, in
front of the temple proper. — tem·
pli: of course at Roma—mira-
culo: i.e. the marvellous size of the
creature, which, as in all cases of
extraordinary occurrences, was re·
garded as a prodzgz'um, or direct
indication of divine interposition;
whence comes our use of prodigy.
5. res: i.e. the birth of the heiser.
