would indicate a doubling of the
number of tribes, which os course
cannot be true in any literal sense.
Perhaps Livy means that, as a basis
for the centurial system, their num·
ber was practically doubled by the
division of each into seniores and
iuniores. This would give 35 >< 2 =
70 centuries in each of the five
classes, or in all 350 centuries of
infantry, making with the equites,
etc„ a total of 373. But our infor·
mation is too scanty to afford a cer·
tain solution of the question. —
summam: sc. centuriarum.

lative os respect. The names were
Suburana, Palatina, Esquilina,
Collina. Livy's words seem. in-
tended to describe these, one of
which was named from a locality,
two from particular hius, and one
from collis.— tribus : these were now
no longer taces, but local divisions. —-
tributo: as usual with ancient ety-
mologies, this is wrong end to; tri·
buo must come from tribus. — eius:
i.e. the tributum: not any regular
tax, but the occasional demands of
the government in emergencies.

These were undoubtedly assigned
locally at first (tribus), but now
were apportioned‚ according to
Livy, among the citizens of the
several local divisions according to
the census. — aequaliter, sairhq not
‘ equally.'—neque, but . . . not. —
eae: in contrast with the later,
which evidently did have to do
with it.
