ducibusque hostium caesis me auctorem sequentes pos·
teri serent.’

Haec templi est orig0, quod primum omnium Rornae 7
sacratum est. Ita deinde diis visum nec inritam condi-
toris templi vocem esse, qua laturos eo spolia posteros
nuncupavit, nec multitudine compotum eius doni vul-
gari laudem. Bina postea inter tot ann03‚ tot bella
opima parta sunt spolia: adeo rara eius fortuna de-

coris suit.
Dum ea ibi Romani gerunt, Antemnatium exercitus 11

per occasionem ac solitudinem hostiliter in fines Roma-
nos incursionem facit; raptim et adhos Romana legio
ducta palantes in agris oppressit. Fusi igitur primo 2
impetu et clamore hosteS‚ oppidum captum, duplicique
victoria ovantem Romulum Hersilia coniunx, precibus
raptarum fatigata, orat ut parentibus earum det veniam

lituus, or augur’s staff. —rne auc·
torem, my example.

7. templi: i.e. of Jupiter Capito-
linus.—primum: perhaps not in-
consistent with chap. 7. 3, because
this might be the first templum
proper ; but no reliance can be
placed on these storieS. —ita: re·
ferring to what follows—nec, not
on tlee one hand—nuncupavit,
solemnly declared .· a religious word
implying solemn forms—nec: cf.
nec above, by which the two state·
ments are opposed to each other.—
compotum, parathen, but with
the idea of a privilege enjoyed. —
bina: on account of the plural,
spolia3 Gr. 95. b. These were won
by A. Cornelius Cossus (IV. 20. 2)
andM.Claudius Marcellus(13.c. 222).

11. per: cf. note to 3. ι 1. —occa-
sionem ac solitudinem: a hendi-

adys; εἶα. the army going home
gave the enemy an opportunity for
an inroad.

et ad hos: i-e. as well as the
Caeninenses before. These proceed-
ings give a very good idea of war

inal meaning of levy or army.
Afterwards, when a larger number
was levied‚ the name remained for
the unit of organization‚ the legion,
as it had formerly been levied.

2. elamore: the viar-cry in an-
cient times had a much more potent
function than now. The armies often
did not meet at all, but, as in a mod·
ern charge, one party broke and
fled before. the collision.— duplici:
i.e. over the army in the field and
in capturing the town. — ovan-
tem, returning in t1·iun1pl1.flushed,
