Deinde est honos additus: non enim, ut ab Romulo

eadem vi eodemque iure promisce omnibus datum est,
sed gradus facti, ut neque exclusus quisquam suffragio
videretur et vis omnis penes primores civitatis esset.
Equites enim vocabantur primi, octoginta inde primae
classis centuriae primurn peditum vocabantur; ibi si
variaret, quod raro incidebat, ut secundae classis voca-
rentur, nec fere umquam infra ita descenderent ut ad
infimos pervenirent. Nec mirari oportet hunc ordinem,

the relative power of the classes of
people. At some time in the third
centuryB „the constitution was so
changed that the first class lost its

arrangements of the constitution in
regard to military service, which
bore harder on the rich, stom the
