the spot was marked, but the tree
could hardly have been standing in
Livy's time, unless Livy supposes it
to be the same that grew in the
Comitium cf. 36. 5. This one must
have been on the slope of the Pal·
atine‚ on the road to the Circus
Maximus. — Ruminalis: from Ru-
mina, a goddess of suckling, proba-
bly with no reference to the wolf
and the twins. — vocatam: i.e.
from that time on.

6. vastae . . . solitudines, a
wilcl, uniuhabited space. — tum:
later it was in the most populous
part os Rome.

tenet, is preserved: not given up
or exploded. —fluitanteme i.e.
floating and not sinking as they ex·
pected it would—lupam: such
stories are found in the myths of
many uadens—puerilem, qs tlte
babes. — flexisse: i.e. was at·
tracted by and turned to, etc.—
earn‚ and that she. This use of a
pronoun in accordance with the
English idiom is not usual in Latin,
but here makes the statement more
significant by separating it from the
τῶι- summissaS, crouching over,
thereby accomplishing the action of
praebuisse by lowering the dugs.
— mitem: where we should expect

an adverb; cf. serae, Pres 11. —
magister: i.e. the king's shepherd.
regii: the emphatic position is
explained by the fondness of the
Latin for emphasizing persons3 cf.
reg-is imperio, 5.
invenerit: for tense cf. immi·

graverint, Prqfi 1 1.

7. Faustulo: cf. T roiano, 1. 3.
The word is a diminutive of Faustus,
and is drawn from the early mythol·
ogy of the Romans. Cf. Faunus
from the same root in fave0.— ad
stabula: because datos implies
that they were taken there. The
shepherds' hut is referred to, where
the sheep were folded at night.—
Larentiae: another name from the
mythology. She is represented with
the name Acca (mother Ρ), as
mother of the Lares Praestites, and
called also Luperca or Lupa. Her
festival was the Larentalia. — sunt
qui. etc.: the Eukemerizing, or

'realistic interpretation of the old

myths, came very early in Rome, and
was especially practised by Ennius3
cf. Gellius, VII. (Vl.) 7, and Macrob.
Ι. ιο, 16.— fabulae ac miracu10,
to the marvellous story. The Romans
were fond of taking an idea apart
and presenting its component parts
separately. This is hardly a rhetori-
