LIVY.

tamquam tertio consuli sustinenti M. Duillius et Cn.

Siccius diem dixere.

Numquam ante tam invisus 3

plebi reus ad iudicium vocatus populi est, plenus sua-
rum, plenus paternarum irarum. Patres· quoque non 4
temere pro ullo aeque adnisi sunt: propugnatorem se-
natus maiestatisque vindicem suae, ad omnes tribuni-
cios plebeiosque oppositum tumultUS‚ modum dumtaxat

in certamine egressum, iratae obici plebi.

Vnus e patri· 5

bus ipse Ap. Claudius et tribunos et plebem et suum

iudicium pro nihilo habebat.

Illum non minae plebiS,

non senatus preces perpellere umquam potuere, non
modo ut vestem mutaret ‚aut supplex prensaret ho·
mineS‚ sed ne ut ex „consueta quidem asperitate oratio·
niS‚ cum ad populum ,agenda causa esset, aliquid leniret

atque submitteret.

Idem habitus oriS, eadem contu· 6

macia in vultu, ide-m in oratione spiritus erat, adeo ut
magna pars plebis Appium non minus reum timeret

and the plebeianS. Perhaps they
are only so called in accordance
with later usage, derived from the
⁶ equestrian order.'

2. tertie, etc.: tle. he was so ac·
tive and took such a leading part,
that he seemed like another consul.
— diem dixere: probably before
the comitia centuriata, as in 35. 2.
The use of plebi and populi in
the next line seems to confirm this.

3. plenus, etc.: a harsh use of
plenus as well as of the possessive
pronoun for the objective genitive.
But the phrase can hardly mean
anything except ‘overwhelmed by
wrath against himself and his father‚’
and we may perhaps justify plenus
by 1. 25. 1, a case not precisely par·
allel, and suarum by 58. 8, taking
irarum as equivalent to odiorum.

4. non temere, not osten ,· prop·
erly, ‘ not without special cause,’ so

that it doesn’t occur by chance. —
propugnatorem, etc.: expressing
the feeling rather than the thought
of the senate, and so approaching the
exclamatory constructions; see Gr.
274. — eune: on account of the in·
direct discourse. — modum dum·
taxat: i.e. he had only gone a
little too far in what was, after all,
the right direction.

5. vestem mutaret: cf. 54. 3 n.
— prensaret: the technical expres·
sion used like our ‘ button—hole.’ —
aliquid: here hardly differing from
quidquam, but giving a slightly dif-
ferent tone, ‘ a little, as one would
have thought he would.’—-leniret‚
sostem— submitteret, humble, from
his lofty tone of arrogance.

6. habitus oris. . . vultu: the
first, of movement of features; the

second, of expression, as of the eyes
or the like.
