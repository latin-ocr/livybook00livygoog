ferociter in absentem Tarquinium erat invectus= haud
mirum esse Superbo ei inditum cognomen—iam enim
ita clam quidem mussitanteS, vulgo tamen, eum appella·
bant—; an quicquam superbius esse quam ludificari sic

alios trucidentur, exsulatum eant, amittant bona, quid
spei melioris Latinis portendi? si se audiant, domum
suam quemque inde abituros neque magis observaturos
diem concilii quam ipse qui indixerit observet.

4. adesse: depending again on
the main verb of saying (implied).
- temptari: the emphasis gives
a force like ‘what he was aiming
at was to try their patience, to see

them submissive and in his power.

— debere: the protases of this
