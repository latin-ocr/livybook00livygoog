LIVY. [Boox ΙΙ.

successum non patribus non consulibus3 externa et do-
mestica odia certare in animis, Tandem superant ex-
terna: adeo superbe insolenterque hostis eludebat.
Frequentes in praetorium conveniunt, poscunt pugnam,
postulant ut signum detur. Consules velut deliberabundi
capita conferunt, diu conloquuntur; pugnare cupiebant,
sed retro revocanda et abdenda cupiditas erat, ut adver-
sando remorandoque incitato semel militi adderent im-
petum. Redditur responsum immaturam rem agi, non·
dum tempus pugnae esse: castris se tenerent. Edicunt
inde ut abstineant pugna; si quis iniussu pugnaverit,
ut in hostem animadversuros Ita dimissis, quo minus
consules velle credunt, crescit ardor pugnandi. Accen-.
dunt insuper hostes ferocius mult0, ut statuisse non
pugnare consules cognitum est: quippe impune se in-
sultaturOS, non credi militi arma, rem ad ultimum sedi-
tionis erupturam, finemque xfenisse Romano imperi0.

—nolle . . . non .. . non: Gr. 209.
a. 2.—externa: i.e. of the enemy ;
see Gr. 217. a (but cf. 2¹3· N.).
-— domestica: i.e. of the patri-
cianS.

6. superant: we should expect
externa first, but there is a rhetori·
cal emphasis in reference to certare,
like ‘at length the contest is de-
cided‚ and the victory remains with
the hatred of the enemy.'—-adeo:
i.e. too much for them to bear.—
eludebat, insult them ,· cf. Ι. 48. 2.
—praetorium: the space in front
of the general’s tent (cf. 47. 5), but
it may be translated headquarters.
-— poscunt. . ‚postulantz the first
has more imperativeness in it than
the second, though here the word
is only varied for rhetorical effect.

7. velut: because their consulta-
tion was only a pretence, as they
knew just what they wanted. --
pugnare, etc„ to fight was just

what they were anxious fhr, to
translate the emphasis. — retro,
etc.: a highly poetical expression
for curbing the desire.

8. redditur: emphatic, as op-
posed to their keepz'ng. back their
true intention, ‘the answer that they
gave was,' eto—agi: i.e. that a
plan was on foot that was not yet
ready, apparently with a kind of
irony; cf. matura res erat, 11.—
edicunt: used of the formal procla·
mation3 important on account of
the threat at the end.

9. quo minus, etc.: τῖε. the less
they think the consuls wish it, the
more they desire it. — ferocius
multo: the emphasis is not on
multo but on ferocius, ‘they were
still fiercer and holder when the
formal determination not to figbt
became known.’ The adverb belongs
grammatically with accendunt, but
modifies an implied occursant.
