lev. [Boon 1.

Servio propere accito cum paene exsanguem virum
ostendisset, dextram tenens orat ne inultam mortem
soceri, ne socrum inimicis ludibrio esse sinat. ‘Tuum
est’ inquit, ‘Servi, si vir eS, regnum, non eorum qui ⁴
alienis manibus pessimum facinus fecere. Erige te
deosque duces sequere, qui clarum hoc fore caput divino
quondam circumfuso igni portenderunt. Nunc te illa
caelestis excitet flamma, nunc expergiscere vere. Et
nos peregrini regnavimus, Qui sis, non unde natus siS,'
reputa. Si tua re subita consilia torpent, at tu ,mea
consilia sequere.’ Cum clamor impetusque multitudinis
vix sustineri posset, ex superiore parte aedium per fene·
stras in Novam viam versas—habitabat enim rex ad
Iovis Statoris —populum Tanaquil adloquitur. Iubet
bono animo esse: sopitum fuisse regem subito ictu, fer·
rum haud alte in corpus descendisse, iam ad se redisse ;
inspectum vulnus absterso cruore3 omnia salubria esse.
