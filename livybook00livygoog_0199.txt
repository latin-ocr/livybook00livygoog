pugnatum cum Sabinis; consules triumpharunt. Maiore 2
inde mole Sabini bellum parabant. Adversus eos et ne
quid simul ab Tuscu10, unde, etsi non apertum, suspectum
tamen bellum erat, repentini periculi oriretur, P. Valerius
quartum T. Lucretius iterum consules facti. Seditio 3
inter belli pacisque auctores orta in Sabinis aliquantum
inde virium transtulit ad RomanoS. Namque Attius 4
ClausuS, cui postea Appio Claudio fuit Romae nomen,
cum pacis ipse auctor a turbatoribus belli premeretur
nec par factioni esset, ab Inregillo magna clientium comi-
tatus manu Romam transfugit. His civitas data agerque 5
trans Anienem ; vetus Claudia tribus, additis postea
novis tribulibuS, qui ex eo venirent agro appellata. Ap-
pius inter patres lectus haud ita multo post in principum
dignationem pervenit. Consules infesto exercitu in 6

5. vetus Claudia⁴ tribus: op-
posed to the new members who
were added to the tribe, not to a
new tribe.—qui: the antecedent

to command. — P. Valeiius quar·

4. Attius Clausus: though this
name might be the same as its
supposed derivative, it ean hardly
be the origin of it. Τὴε whole
