LIVY.

magna trepidatione agrestium populantur, tumultusque
repens ex agris in urbem inlatus pro nuntio fuit. Excitus 6
Romulus, neque enim dilationem pati tam vicinum bel—
lum poterat, exercitum educit, castra a Fidenis mille

passuum locat.

Ibi modico praesidio relicto egressus 7

omnibus copiis partem militum locis circa densa inter
virgulta obscuris subsidere in insidiis iussit; cum parte
maiore atque omni equitatu profectus, id quod quaere-
bat, tumultuoso et minaci genere pugnae adequitando

ipsis prope portis hostem excivit.

Fugae quoque, quae

simulanda erat, eadem equestris pugna causam minus

mirabilem dedit.

Et cum velut inter pugnae fugaeque

consilium trepidante equitatu pedes quoque referret

alarm or any other cause.—agres·
tium: i.e. outside the towns—tu·
multus, disorderly fizglzt. — pro
nuntio: i.e. brought the first news,
as there had been no declaration
of war.

6. excitus: i.e. called out to ac·
tion. The cities in those times were
practically impregnable. The usual
course of warfare was as in this
case.—neque enim, for naturally
. . . not. This expression regularly
introduces a statement which itself
needs no argument, like our ‘for
you see‚' ‘for you know.'

7. egressus: from the camp,
which was always strongly fortified.
—- omnibus copiis: as opposed to
a mere detachment. Cf. the em·
phatic modico, which indicates that
only a small guard was left behind.
— locis, etc.: the reading given
here (Weissenborn’s) is doubtful,
but perhaps the best conjecture
that can be made. The Mss. have
densa obsita virgulta. — eirca: to
be taken as an adverb. Cf. Gr.
188. e. -id quod, etc.: i.e. he suc-
ceeded in doing what he aimed at,
namely, excivit. Cf. excituS, 6.—

tumultuoso: i.e. the irregular ac-
tion of skirmishing. — fugae: geni-
tive. — simulanda, etc.: i.e. was
necessary to draw the enemy into
the ambuscade. — mirabilem: the
flight would have seemed suspicious,
but that sudden dashes and retreats
were the regular cavalry tactics.

8. velut: apparently only belong·
ing with inter . . . consilium,
though grammatically it might go
with the abl. abs. This sentence is a
good example of Livy's compression
of many details into one complex
sentence. Our logical analysis into
main clause and successively subor-
dinate ones is almost sure to miss
the manner of presentation chosen
by the author. The only way to
read the sentence is as it is written,
something like And as, while the cav-
alry were waverz'ng between the two
courses of battle and fliglzt, tlte fhot
also began to draw back, tlze gates
were suddenly seen crowded with
men, and from them poured a host
of tlte enemy ,· so, as tlte Roman line
gave way, tlte zeal os the enemy to
press on and pursue hurried them
on to tlte place of the ambuscade.
