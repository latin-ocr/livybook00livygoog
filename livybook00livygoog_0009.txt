PREFACE.

-Ἄ-

Tm: editor holds, as he has often said elsewhere, that the
essential object of studying Latin is to learn to read Latin
with readiness and accuracy 3, that the proper method of learn-
ing to read is to try to read, in the form and the order in .
which the author presents his ideas and conceptions, and
with as little translation into the vemacular as possible. This
is especially true of Livy, who is a professional raconteur,
always aiming to produce a graphic effect on the mind of his
reader. This book is accordingly edited with a view to that
object and that method. Discussions of historical and gratn-
matical points have been made subordinate to the presentation
of Livy's exact ideas as they lay in his mind, and the precise

order in which in their parts and their totality he intended
to present them. The teacher as well as the pupil will per-

haps miss some historical and grammatica] lore and many
translations which they have become accustomed to associate
with classical studieS‚ but which the editor has purposely
omitted. Yet in compensation it is hoped that both will be
led to a better' knowledge of the author and of the Latin
language than they would get by following the customary

method of exhaustive comment on irrelevant topics.
