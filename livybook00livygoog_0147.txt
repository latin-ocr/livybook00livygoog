CHAPS. 48, 49.] LIVY. 125

Inde L. Tarquinius regnare occepit, cui Superbo co· 49
gnomen facta indiderunt, quia socerum gener sepultura
prohibuit, Romulum quoque insepultum perisse dictitans,
primoresque patrum, quos Servi rebus favisse credebat, 2
interfecit; conscius deinde male quaerendi regni ab se
ipso adversus se exemplum capi posse, armatis corpus
circumsaepsit; neque enim ad ius regni quicquam prae· 3
ter vim habebat, ut qui neque populi iussu neque aucto-
ribus patribus regnaret. Eo accedebat ut in caritate 4
civium nihil spei reponenti metu regnum tutandum es-
set. Quem ut pluribus incuteret, cognitiones capitalium
rerum sine consiliis per se solus exercebat, perque eam 5
causam occidere, in exsilium agere, bonis multare poterat
non suspectos modo aut inviSOS, sed unde nihil aliud ·
quam praedam sperare posset.

Praecipue ita patrum nurnero imminuto statuit nullos 6

set: the more common construction
with accedere is quod, but here the
state of things is conceived as a re·
sult.—spei= his own hope3 metu:
his subjects' fear; such close juxta·
position of two ideas from different
points of view is allowed by the an-
cients‚ though we are a little more
squeamish. — cognitiones, trials,
