Enetos Troianosque eas tenuisse terras.

Et in quem

iano inde nomen est ; gens universa Veneti appellati.

bene.—-et, and in sact,· as still
appears; though, of course, these
names may have been given from the
story. Tffls is a remark of Livy out·
side of the indirect discourse.

in quern . . . locum: see Gr.
200. b. — primo: i.e. their first land-
ing, though they afterwards con-
quered the whole country.—Tro-
iano: the name; see Gr. 231.b. —
—universa, united,· i.e. including
both stemS.

Veneti ε the resemblance of name
may have been merely an accident
giving rise to the story; but such
migrations were common in early
times, and the story may possibly
be true in its main features.

appellati: attracted to the near-
est noun3 see Gr. 204. b.

4. Aeneam: cf. Antenorem, 2.
—ab, from.

maiora: we should expect maio-
rum ,· but it is almost a tendency of
the Latin, especially in poetry, to
make an adjective agree with some
subordinate but grammatically lead-
ing part of · a complex idea. Cf.
Aen. VII. 44, maior rerum ordo.

rerum: we should say destiny:
but Livy has in his mind the Roman
state. s'f. res Romana, 9. 1.

fatis: a common idea with the
Romans. Cf. Aen. 1. 2, ΙΙΙ. 182,
VII. 123.

Macedoniam: there was a city
AEnea in this province, perhaps con-
nected with the worship of Venus,
to which cult this name AEneas es·
pecially belongs, Cf. Aen. 111. 17,
which probably refers to the same
place.

Siciliam: Segeste was very early
11.ξὲιῖιὶἮέεά {sisa dekiggrelclatttigoebssg'ltig
of AEneas was connected with the
worship of Venus on Mount Eryx,
and perhaps came from that region
by way of Cumae to Latium. Cf.
Aen. Book V., and Tac. Ann. IV.

Laurentem agrum: this region
lies south of the mouth of the Tiber.
Its chief city was Laurentum, about
fifteen miles southwest from Rome
and a little southeast from Ostia.
Cf. Aen. VII. 171.-tenuisse: sc.
cursum, which is often omitted.

5. Troia: the emphasis causes
the nominative instead of the more
common dative3 cf. T roiam, 3. —-
et huic: the name seems to have
become attached to several places,
probably only through the influence
of the myth.; cf. Cic. Att. IX. 13. 6,
Troianum (praedz'um).--ibi: Vir-
gil puts the landing farther north, by
the mouth of the Tiber.—ut qui-

predatory excursions3 in the char-
acteristic relative construction, a
