hinted at in the metamorphosed nar-
rative. Aricia (ef Ι. 50. 3),with the
help of the Greek colony of Cumae,
seems to have stayed their advanee.

6. perculerat: cf. consalutaverat,
1. 7. 1 n, and intulerant, below.
—arcessita, etc.: the emphasis
gives the force, ‘but having re·
ceived upon application assistance
from their neighbors, they ven·
tured,’ etc.—funderent, etc.: no-
tice the chiastic antithesis· This is

7. declinavere: i.e. withdrew to

for number of the verb, see Gr. 205.

to their entertainment just spoken
of.—caritas, affection for,- but in
Latin the idea is looked at (as
osten) srorn the other end as the
‘dearness' to them of the objects
of affection3 cf. Gr. 213 and note.
— Tuscum vicum: a narrow
street just under the Palatine, be-

the river. It was the place of busi-
