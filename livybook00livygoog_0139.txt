civis Dianae immolasset, ibi fore imperium, idque car-
men pervenerat ad antistitem fani Dianae ; Sabinusque, 6
ut prima apta dies sacrificio visa est, bovem Romam
actam deducitxad fanum Dianae et ante aram statuit.
Ibi antistes Romanus, cum eum magnitudo victimae
celebrata fama movisset, memor responsi, Sabinum ita
adloquitur: ‘Quidnam tu hospes paras?' inquit3 ‘in-
ceste sacrificium Dianae facere? Quin tu ante vivo
perfunderis flumine? Infima valle praefluit Tiberis)
Religione tactus hospeS, qui omnia, ut prodigio respon· ⁷
deret eventuS, cuperet rite facta, externplo descendit ad
Tiberim; interea Romanus immolat Dianae bovem. Id
mire gratum regi atque civitati fuit.

Servius quamquam iam usu haud dubie regnum pos· 46
sederat, tamen, quia interdum iactari voces a iuvene

—cecinerez cf. 7. 10, and Virgil
passim—cuius: its antecedent is
concealed in ibi—immolassem
for future perfect of the direct dis-
course (school-boy lore, but very
hard to learn).—ibi: τῖε. in ea
(civitate); cf. 24. 2.

6. Sabinusque: by means of
the -que, Livy jumps over the last
digression, and attaches the rest of
the story to 4. — ibi, thereupon. —
memor, reminded ofl — responsi:
the same as carmen above. — quid-
nam, why! what? —-· paras, are
you gving to do? — inceste, with-
out purffication ,· the sacrifice would
be ceremonially impure if he pro-
ceeded immediately from his sec·
ular occupations without ablution.
-tut not properly emphatic, but
expressed from the fondness of the
Latin for emphasized pronounS, es·
pecially in colloquial language. —
perfunderis, bathe ,· a very com-
mon middle use of verbs of this sort.
—praefluitz Livy often uses prae
in composition instead of praeter.

7. religione, religious scruple,·
a doubt whether he might not in-
validate the sacrifice by something
unpleasing to the goddess—pro-
digio: the birth of the heifer, and
the sacrifice, if duly performed to-
gether, constituted, according to
ancient religions, a kind of deter-
mination of fate, and all this taken
together is meant by prodigium.
The event was, according to our
ideas, to conform to the prophecy,
but as the prophecy is only an in-
terpretation of the fate, Livy's words
express exactly the ancient notion.
