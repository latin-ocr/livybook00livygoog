LIVY.

[BooKI.

Auguriis certe *sacerdotioque ⁴augurum tantus honos
accessit ut nihil belli domique postea nisi auspicato
gereretur, concilia populi, exercitus vocati, summa rerum,

7 ubi aves non admisissent, dirimerentur.

Neque tum

Tarquinius de equitum centuriis quicquam mutavit; nu-
mero alterum tanturn adiecit, ut mille octingenti equites

s in tribus centuriis essent.

Posteriores modo sub isdem'

nominibus qui additi erant appellati sunt, quas nunc,
quia geminatae sunt, sex vocant centuriaS.
Hac parte copiarum aucta iterum cum Sabinis con-

fligitur.

Sed praeterquam quod viribus creverat Roma-

nus exercituS, ex occulto etiam additur dolus, missis qui
‘magnam vim lignorum, in Anienis ripa iacentem, arden·

tem in flumen conicerent;

ventoque iuvante accensa

ligna, et pleraque impacta in ratibus sublicis cum hae-

6. certe: i.e. whether the old
tradition is true or not. — nihil,
etc.: i.e. whereas augury had only
been used for the most important
matters, now nothing os any account
was done without it. -- concilia
Qun: probably the comitia tri-

. —exercitusz the comitia cen-
turiata, which was assembled as
a military muster; cf. 44. 1. —
summa rerum, acts of tlte highest
moment, in apposition with the pre-
ceding. - admisissent: cf. ubi
dixisset, 32. 1 3 n. — dirimerentur:
i.e. the bodies called together for
the highest functions of the state
are dissolved again, is the omens
are unfavorable. This power of in-
terrupting proceedings by real or
Eretended auspices (obnuntiatio)

ecame a potent factor in politics,
and continued through the republic.
· 7. neque turn: i.e. Tarquin was
prevented from doing what he in-
tended on that occasion; an exam-
ple under the general rule just given.
—mutavitt i.e. he did not add a

new division, he only increased the
number, which was not an innova-
tion.—alterum tantum, as many
more ,· cf. ‘as much again! Livy
probably wrote the words in this
order, though the MSS. have tan-
tum alterum, here and X. 46. —
mille octingenti: this number does
not agree with Livy’s other accounts
(cf. 13. 8, 30. 3), but it is to be
remembered that Livy does not claim
exactness3 and as accounts differed,
he takes sometimes one and some·
times another. The whole subject
is in utter confusion.

8. modo: i.e. only they did have
a distinctive name, posteriores -
geminatae: from three to six.—
sex centurias ε regularly sex suffra-
gia, as having, under the Servian
constitution, six votes as centuries.
The number of persons is uncertain.

WAR wrm THE SAmNES.

37 . ex occulto: opposed to the
increased Roman strength, which
was an open advantage. — arden·
