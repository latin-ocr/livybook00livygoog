Quibus cum

responsum esset missurum ad regem senatum legatos,
missi confestim honoratissimus quisque e patribus: non ε
quin breviter reddi responsum potuerit, non recipi regeS,
ideo potius delectos patrum ad eum missos quam legatis
eius Romae daretur responsum, sed ut in perpetuum
mentio eius rei finiretur, neu in tantis mutuis beneficiis
in vicem animi sollicitarentur, cum ille peteret quod con-
tra libertatem populi Romani esset, Romani, nisi in per· ·
niciem suam faciles esse vellent, negarent cui nihil

ness for those who dealt in materi-
als for luxury and dissipation. The
reason for the name here given is
probably not the true one. It was

more likely the place of Tuscan
merchandise.

15. Sp. Larcius, etc.= the text
is here so confused in the manu·
scripts that the names of the con-
suls cannot be made out with cer·
tainty. That Publicola was one of
them is inferred from 16. 2. —ho-
notatissimus quisque: indicating
a large and imposing embassy, not
two or three envoys.

2. breviter: tle. without sending
the embassy to say what-they had
already determined on. -—- potuerit:
representing a potuit (independent
of the quin construction); see Gr.
308. c; it is not necessary to sup·
pose a protasis in all these cases,
but the construction is the same as
if there were one. For connection
of tenses, see Gr. 287. c. N.; the
proper posset would not represent
the perfect, which is required in
this construction. For the quin

construction, see Gr. 321, Rem. —
recipi: the tense represents in ef-
fect a present indicative (non reci-
pimus), a regular colloquial form
of refusal3 cf. non emo, I'm not
buying = I won’t buy, and see Gr.
276. c.—ideo: referring back to
quin, and best omitted in transla-
tion. —rnissos z an indirect quota-
tion from the supposed argument in
favor of the course pursued. It
sounds like a far away echo of the
senatorial or diplomatic debate on
the subject. — daretur: the regular
construction aster such compari·
sons as this is a result clause with
ut, but the ut is omitted in all peri-
ods, particularly in early' I-atin; see
Gr. 332. b.—ut, etc.: the purpose
of their action opposed to the rea·
son just negatived. —- in vicem:
belonging with sollicitarentur, op-
posed to mutuis, and anticipating
the cum clauses ille peteret, Ro-
mani negarent. —vellentz if this
part of the answer were indepen-
dent both of the purpose and os the
cum construction, it would be ‘Ro-
mani nisi. . . velint (potential subj.),
negant cui nihil . . . velint) — ne·
garum: see Gr. 292. d. N.
