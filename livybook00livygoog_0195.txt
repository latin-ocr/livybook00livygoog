ought to mean ‘ was there once,'
but not in Livy's time; Seneca,
however, speaks of it (ad Marc.
16. 2) as still existing.

14· profectioni: the dative with
abhorreo is peculiar to this place,
and the ablative without a prepo-
sition is not common. lt may be a
kind of construction according to
the sense. — cetera sollemnia: i.e.
those used at public sales of booty.
—bona, etc.: a part of the booty
was apparently so described at the
sale.

2. omissam: attracted to agree-
ment with originem, though it,
as well as crevisse, belongs with
moris. — titulus: the notice of
sale in which the property to be
sold was enumerated. — hostiliter:
i.e. as the property of an enemy,
opposed to the peaceable character

of the settlement of affairs as de·
scribed; cf. the same word in 4.
Of course the whole story has been
entirely made over, and the custom
may have originated in a grim joke
like ‘catching a Tartar.’ But in
Livy‘s time they doubtless believed
in the varnished account os the
Etruscan wars.

4. ea: i.e. the castra, meaning
the property left therein. — fortu-
nae: curiously like our own use of
‘ fortune’ for large possessionS. —
in potestatem: a construction with
esse peculiar to this phrase; see
Gell. I. 7. 16. — esset: indirect
discourse after significante; see
Gr. 1. c.

Etruria, no doubt, spread over the
whole of Latium after the conquest
os Rome, and this occupatiori is
