10. has, such. — domicilio, etc.:

9. accepisse: the acceptance of
iae. establishing themselves there,

an omen was, in ancient times, an

important part os the process. Cf.
7. 11.—augurium: in its general
sense of omen. — Etrusci: this na·
tion was much given to divination,
and all the Roman forms of the art
were supposed to have come from
them. In cases of doubt they were
consulted as experts. — excelsa,
etc.: the emphatic position of these
words represents a direct form like
‘excelsa ’ inquit ‘ spera? complexa
virum. —complexaz see note on
relicta, 2.

ea regione: i.e. the favorable
side. —eius dei: i.e. of Jupiter.—
venisse: the clauses in the infini-
tive contain the grounds of hope.
The preceding main clause would
properly be a result, ut sperare
possis, correlative to the demonstra-
tives eam, ea, eius, but the account
represents the colloquial form used
by the woman herself. Of course
the whole proceeding meant that
he would gain a crown for his head,

not merely taking a house. - L.
Tarquinium: probably called Lu-
cius because of the name (or, rather,
title) Lucumo, It is possible that
the word may have originally been
formed from Lucumo. The deriva-
tion of Roman proper names is very
obscure. The gentile name is doubt·
less formed from Tarquinii.— Pri-
scum: this part of the name is cer-
tainly Latin, but its application is
uncertain.

11. ipse: opposed to the acci·
dental advantages just mentioned.
- fortunam: i.e. his rise in social
position. - adloquio, comitate,
beneficiis: the means of concili-
ando, which is itself the means of
adiuvabat. — comitate, etc.: τῖε.
by hospitably entertaining his new
acquaintances. -- adiuvabat, con-
tinued to improve. — regiam: i.e.
he made himself so conspicuous so-
cially, that the king heard os him
and made his acquaintance (noti-
tiam).
