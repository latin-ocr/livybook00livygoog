LIVY.

[Boox 11.

Multis saepe bellis, pestilentia postremo amissa

iuventute fractos spiritus esse ; arte agendum in exoleto
iam vetustate odio, ut recenti aliqua ira exacerbarentur

animi.¹

Ludi forte ex instauratione magni Romae paraban-

tur.

Instaurandi haec eausa fuerat : ludis mane servum

quidam pater familiae nondum commisso spectaculo sub

furca caesum medio egerat circ0.
2 ea res nihil ad religionem pertinuisset.

Coepti inde ludi, velut
Haud ita multo

post Tito Latini0‚ de plebe homini, somnium fuit. Visus
Iuppiter dicere sibi ludis praesultatorem displicuisse ;
nisi magnifice instaurarentur ii ludi, periculum urbi fore3

Quamquam haud sane

liber erat religione animus, verecundia tamen maiesta-

suppose it would be very easy‚' etc„
‘ and so they felt they must use arti·
fiee! — ira, cause of anger.

36. ludi magni: apparently
vowed by Postumius in the Latin
war. It was not yet a regular
festival, as it afterwards became,
with the name ludi Romani. —
instauratione: in any sacred ob-
servance‚ if anything faulty oc·
curred‚ the whole had to be gone
over again, for which the regular
term was instaurare, a word of
doubtful etymology. — ludis: cf.
bello Latino, 26. 2. — commisso:
a natural word, since the games
consisted of races.—-caesum: not
to be distinguished here from a
present passive participle, which the
Latin lacks; cf. Gr. 290. b. Cicero
uses cum caederetur (de Div. 1. 55).
—ad religionem, with tlte sacred
gamem properly, with the religious
character of the proceedings3 i.e.
with the desecration of them. The

praesultator),

word appears to have originally
meant the noticing and taking care
of any portentous appearance, but
came to have a wide range, some·
times meaning, as here, a religious
difficulty, sometimes the feeling or
perception of it, as in 3, some-
times (in a bad sense) superstition,
sometimes (in a good sense) religion.

2. praesultatorem, tlte head dan-
cer. Evidently the Romans had in
their native cults a ritual os dancing
(like our savages) , which was an im-
portant part of their religion. These
rites were performed by a chorus
(cf. the Salian priests), led by a
chief dancer (praesul, praesultor,
whose movements
were followed by the others (origi-
nally consules, from which the name
might come to mean colleagues,
and afterwards be used to desig·
nate the two sharers of the supreme
power in place of the king). In
Jupiter’s divine riddle this leader
is identified with the whipped slave.

2. de plebe: cf. 1. 50. 3 n.

3. liber, etc. τ i.e. he was not un·
