mento pecuniam acceptam retribui populo, Id vero 9
haud secus quam praesentem mercedem regni aspernata
plebes: adeo propter suspicionem insitam regni, velut
abundarent omnia, munera eius in animis hominum re-
spuebantur. Quem, ubi primum magistratu abiit, darn- 10
natum necatumque constat. Sunt qui patrem auctorem
eius supplicii ferant: eum cognita domi causa verberasse
ac necasse, peculiumque filii Cereri consecravisse; sig-
num inde factum esse et inscriptum ‘ Ex Cassia familia
datum.’ Invenio apud quosdam, idque propius fidem ει
est, a quaestoribus Caesone Fabio et L. Valerio diem
dictam perduellionis, damnatumque populi iudici0, di·-

rutas publice aedes.

-— vilior, less esteemed, but with the
literal force that we express by
‘cheapening one's sels.’-— Siculo:
cf. 34. 3. and 7. — pecuniam . . .
retribui: the grain would thus be-
come a gratuitous distribution, such
as was afterwards practiced.

9. id vero: cf. tum vero, often
commented on. — praesentem,
downright,· literally, paid on the
spot, and so a direct price paid by
Cassius for the regal power. The
ignorant prejudices of the people
were fully roused by the crafty no-
bles. — insitam, deep-scaled ,· i.e.
the natural hatred of the people to
iggal power. — abundarent: see

r. 312.

10. ubi, ete.: a magistrate as
such could not be attacked while
in office, but upon its expiration he
became like any other private citi·
zen. — sunt qui, etc.: these read
like later comment and explanation
of the meagre facts as stated in the
annals.— cognita, etc. t i.e. he acted
as judge, and formally tried the son,
over whom the patria potestas, sus-
pended during the magistracy, was
again restored at its expiration; cf.

Ea est area ante Telluris aedem.

Ι. 26. 9. — peculium: the son was
the property of the father, and could
own nothing, but was allowed, like
a slave, to enjoy some property as if
it were his own.-—Cereri: cf. sa-
crando cum bonis, etc„ 8. 23 he
was apparently put to death by the
law of Valerius Publicola there men-
tioned. — signum: cf. Plin. N. H.
XXXIV. 15, Romae simulacrum ex
aere sactum Cereri primum reperio
ex peculio Sp. Cassi. — familia:
here used in its regular sense of
res familiaris.

11. fidem: see Gr. 261. a. —
quaestoribus: not in the later
sense of officers of the treasury, but
of commissioners who acted partly
as judges in the first instance, and
partly as prosecutors before the peo-
ple; cf. the appeal of Horatius, I.
26. 8.—diem dictam: cs. 35. 2 n.
— perduellionis ε very likely a later
attempt to bring the case under some
general class of offences ; cf. Cic. de
Rep. II. 35. 60, Sp. Cassium de oc-
cupando regno molientem quaestor
accusavit, etc. — populi: in the co·
mitia centuriata, doubtleSS.- Tel-
