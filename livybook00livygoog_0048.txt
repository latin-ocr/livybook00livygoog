nomen patremque ac patriam accepit, ‘Iove nate, Her-
cules, salve,' inquit. ‘ Te mihi mater, veridica interpres
deum, aucturum caelestium numerum cecinit tibique

tiorem: properly, with habitum,
though attracted to formam; hu·
mana: belonging to both, but agree-
ing in gender with formam. — qui:
cf. qui mortales, 1. 7, and see Gr.
104. a.

10. patremque: notice the di-
vision into groupS, the first two
words in one, and the last one in
the other.

Iove, etc.: in accordance with
the answer given to his question.
—auctururnz the standard expres-
sion for being added to anything;
cf. Aen. V. 565. —cecinit: cf. Car·
mentae, 8 n. This prophecy accounts
for the dedication of the altar be-
fore the apotheosis of the hero.
—maximamz the altar so called
stood in the low ground by the
Tiber, near the gate of the Circus
Maximus. It was no doubt erected
under Greek influence, and seems
to have been connected from very
early times with the foreign trade
of the city. Upon it bargains were
solemnized, and the deity, by the
name Dius Fidius, was identified
with Semo SancuS, the Sabine god
of faith; see Mommsen, Book I.
chap. xii. — ritu: every cult had its
own peculiar ritual, either borrowed
from abroad or developed from very
early times; cf. Graeco Herculi, 3.

The chief peculiarities of this rite
were: offering with uncovered head,
consuming the'offering sitting, and
the exclusion of women, —all Greek
forms, introduced, doubtless, by the
early merchants along with the
divinity himself.

11. accipere: a regular word
upon the announcement of onienS.
It would seem to have been ueces-
sary for the favored mortal to accept
the favorable omen to make it valid.
Cf. accipio omen, mea filia, Cic. de
Div. 1. 46. 1033 and Serv. to Aen.
V. 530, nostri arbitrii estvisa omina
vel improbare vel recipere.—imple-
turum: i.e. so far as he was con-
cerned‚ by erecting and dedicating
the altar; cf. IX. 34. 183 Aen.
VIII. 271; Prop. V. 9. 67.

12. primumi the first offering
to inaugurate the cult.—ministe·
rium: i.e. as assistants to Hercules,
who probably is conceived as having
acted as chief priest. — Potitiis ac
Pinariis: the names seem manufac·
tured; but they may well be relies
of descriptive names in some still
older rites; cs. IX. 29. 9; Virg. Aen.
VIII. 269 seq. - familiae : logically
appositive to the names, but, ac·
cording to Latin usage, absorbed
into the relative clause; cf. Gr.
201. d.
