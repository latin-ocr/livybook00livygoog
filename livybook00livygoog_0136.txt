LIVY.

[Boon 1. ,

Milia octoginta eo lustro civium
Adicit scriptorum antiquissimus Fabius

Pictor, eorum qui arma ferre possent eum numerum

fuisse.

Ad eam multitudinem urbs quoque amplificanda visa
est. Addit duos colleS, Quirinalem Viminalemque ; inde
deinceps auget EsquiliaS, ibique ipse, ut loco dignitas

fieret, habitat.

hence later closed, when the final
act was used for the intervening
period.- censendo, the enrollment,
referring to the whole process by
which every five years the censors
⁴ numbered the people,' and assigned
the rank of individuals according to
property.— lustro : this word, mean-
ing only the final act of purification,
was used of the whole process of
numbering.— adicit: of course a
different account from that just
given, but as F abius’ view exagger-
ates the number, Livy may prop-
erly say adds. This view would
make the number about five times

as great.

3. ad, in accordance with ,· a char·
acteristic loos: use of the preposition.
——urbs quoque : as the population
had been. —·-addit: sc. Servius.—
duos colleS, ete.: increasing the
city towards the north, on the other
side of the Forum. The two hills are
two projecting ridges of the high
plateau of the Esquiline.—Quiri-
nalem: this can hardly be true,
for on this hill are some of the very
oldest monuments of the city, and
it is said by other authorities to have
been the abode of the Sabines from
the time of Romulus. — inde, then,
of time; deinceps, next, of suc-
cession. — auget Esquilias: by
increasing the population, as it was
no doubt inhabited before. ΤΙιε

Aggere et fossis et muro circumdat
4 urbem; ita pomerium profert.

Pomerium verbi vim

derivation of the word (ex-colo)
seems to imply that the hill was a
suburb which Servius now adds to
the city proper. — habitat: cf. 41.
4. —aggere, etc.: these fortifica-
tions have been traced for almost
their entire length. The most prom-
inent part of them is the great ern·
bankment, some portions of which
still exist, on the east side, where
the city is most exposed. It was a
bank 21 feet high, t‘aced with stone,
originally surrounded by a ditch, as
was probably the rest of the fortifi-
cation. The wall of Tarquinius
Priscus (36. 1, 38. 6) was either
not finished or not large enough.
—itaz in reference to the increase
of the interior implied in circum-
dat urbem. — pomerium: origi·
nally a space left vacant inside (and
so behind) the walls to facilitate
defensive operations. After cities
began to develop suburbs, the same
usage would continue in regard to
the anaide, and this part of the space
carne, from religious considerations,
to be the most important part.
Hence the necessity of Livy's ex·
planation. Cf. Gellius XIII. 14, po-
merium est locus intra agrum qffa-
tum per totius urbis circuitum pone
muros regionibue certis determina-
tus, qui facit finem urbani auspicii.
In later times the limit of this space
was held sacred, and only such
