Ita rem inter se centurn patres, decem decuriis factis

circumstances, though they all stand
in the same relation to the main
thought. If the sentence will
parse, that is enough, and even
that is sometimes overlooked. —

were ten who had the magisterial
power (imperitabant), but one
only who had the insignia. Livy
does not distinctly say, and only
blindly implies, that the college

the singular never means, but vio·

(see 13. 5) Livy does not say. Prob-
abl y in the multitude of varying tra·
ditions he didn't know very well
himself. —decem, etc.: the state-
ment, as near as ean be made out
of Livy's words, is that the senators
shared the regal power, acting ten
at a time as a college (cf. the later
decemviri). One senator was chosen
from and sor each decury (singulis
1N singulas decurias) as a presi·
dent of the college and formal sov-

changed at all. But as Dionysius'
account indicates that it did, we may
presume that Livy conceived the
matter the same way. N either the
hundred senators of Livy nor the two
hundred os Dionysius (ΙΙ. 57) divided
into decuries holding five days apiece
(quinque dierum spatio) would
make an even year. If, however,
there were three hundred, as is most
likely, a hundred of each great stock‚

then two turns would make out a·

year of three hundred days. But
the subject is a much mooted one.
— creatis: this word must be used
of the election of the one man who
held the insignia. —- consociant:
the patres- divided the power among
them, holding it, however, only
ten at a time, but all holding it
successively (per omnes in or·
bem).
