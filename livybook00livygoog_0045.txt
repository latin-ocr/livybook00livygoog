ictus Remus cecidit. Vulgatior fama est ludibrio fratris
Remum novos transiluisse murOS, inde ab irato Romulo,
cum verbis quoque increpitans adiecisset ‘Sic deinde
quicumque alius transiliet moenia meal’, interfectum.

Sacra diis aliis Albano ritu, Graeco Herculi, ut ab Euan-

Herculem in ea loca Geryone 4

interempto boves mira specie abegisse memorant ac
prope Tiberim fluvium, qua prae se armentum agens

muros: see 44. 3, and note.
The act was a kind of sacrilege.—

3. condita: the city was not fully
built until after the fracaS, so that
Romulus was the founder in either
case. Livy derives Roma from
Romulus, which is etymologically
impossible. —nominez abl. of sep·
aration3 cf. ab nomine, 23. 3.—
Palatium: the hill which was the
site os the earliest city, or at least
the citadel of it. Remains of the⁴
earliest walls are still to be seen
on the hill. They did not occupy
the whole of the summit, which
was originally divided by a ravine
into two parts, of which only the
northwestern one was occupied
by the citadel or Roma Quadrata.
— sacra: in the minds of the
ancients, an idea inseparable from
the founding of a city, and hence
next mentioned.‚—-aliis. the other,-
as often in Livy. —Albanoz tle.

old Italian. See Introd. 4. —
ritu: the ritual of Greek worship
and of Italian seems to have been
distinctly different.

Herculi: the worship of Her·
cules must have been very early
introduced by Greek merchantS.
His altar, the Ara Maxima, was in
the low land by the river, west of
the Palatine, where must have been
the commercial quarter; and this
altar had a special connection with
good saith in bargains. In the
growth of legends the worship .
was naturally associated with Evan-
der.

cult.

4. Herculem: this divinity, who
came to the Greeks from the Phoe·
nicians, had as his tenth labor to
steal the cattle of Geryon, the three-
headed monster of the island of
Erytheia. To accomplish this seat,
he passed westward along North
Africa, and, crossing at the Pillars
of Hercules into Spain, on the coast
of which the island was supposed
to be, returned with the cattle
by way of Europe. It was on this
return that he was supposed to have

come to Italy.
