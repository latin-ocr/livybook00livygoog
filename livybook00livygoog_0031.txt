LIVY.

esset, cum praedam ex agris agerent, Latinus rex
Aboriginesque, qui tum ea tenebant loca, ad arcendam
vim advenarum armati ex urbe atque agris concurrunt.
Duplex inde fama est: alii proelio victum Latinum 6
pacem cum Aenea, deinde adfinitatem iunxisse tradunt3
alii, cum instructae acies constitissent, priusquam signa ⁷
canerent, processisse Latinum inter primores ducemque
advenarum evocasse ad conloquium 3 percunctatum deinde
qui mortales essent, unde aut quo casu profecti domo
quidve quaerentes in agrum Laurentem exissent, post· 8
quam audierit multitudinem Troianos esse, ducem
Aeneam filium Anchisae et VeneriS, cremata patria

favorite one with Livy3 properly,
‘ as persons to whom‚' etc„ ‘ as men
would naturally do,' etc.

Latinus: see Aen. VII. 45.—
urbe: i.e. Laurentum. The ancient
commonwealths consisted of an op-
pidum, a fortified city which was the
centre and citadel, and the ager, as
much land—usually ten or a dozen
miles across—as could be cultivated
and defended by operations from the
city. In case of invasion, the per·
sons and property were taken into
the city for security, and the coun-
try abandoned, or else the militia
was rallied to repel the invaders.
— Aborigines ε it is uncertain
whether this has a real or only a

opular Latin etymology. It may
have been a tribe, but was supposed
to mean the original inhabitants οἱ
Italy.

6. inde, from thatpoint.—pr0e·
lio: the emphasis gives the force,
‘ Some say there was an actual bat-
tle; others, that only the lines were
formed,' etc.— adfinitatem: i.e. by
the marriage with Lavinia.

7. inter primores, to the frent,-
lamong those who fought in the first
me.

mortales: used by Sallust and
later writers for hanzines. The use
of the word at all adds a little em-
phasis to the question, like ‘what
manner of men they were,’ or ‘who
the strangers were.’ — unde . . .
domo: i.e. ‘where was their home,
and by what chance they had come
away from it?’ Vnde domo are
often used together, but here domo
is connected also with quo casu.—
aut: we should expect et,· but the
Latin often presents questions, like
negatives, disjunctively3 so quid·
ve. This form of expression gives
a peculiar force to a question, like
‘ Who are you, or why have you left
your homes (any way, whoever you
are) Ρ We don't know you, nor have
you any business to be away from
home, nor at any rate to be making

depredations on our land.' So Aen.

8. audierit: in direct discourse‚
audivit, and the tense is retained
(Gr. 336. B. a). — multitudinem=
i.e. the people in general; cf. 2. n.
—Troianosx answer to qui rnor-
tales and unde; cremata: an-
swer to quo casu3 sedem: answer
to quidve quaerentes. — patria,
