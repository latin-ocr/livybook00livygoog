CHAPS. 43, 44]

LIVY.

si pluribus opus sit, tribunos ad auxilium consulum para-

tos fore, et unum vel adversus ornnes satis esse.

Da· 4

rent modo et consules et primores patrum operam ut,
si minus omneS, aliquos tamen ex tribunis rei publicae

ac senatui conciliarent.

Praeceptis Appii moniti patres 5

et universi comiter ac benigne tribunos appellare, et
consulareS, ut cuique eorum privatim aliquid iuris ad-
versus singulos erat, partim gratia partim auctoritate
obtinuere ut tribuniciae potestatis vires salubres vel-
lent rei publicae esse; novemque tribunorum adver· 6
sus unum moratorem publici commodi auxilio dilectum

· consules habent.

Inde ad Veiens bellurn profecti, quo 7

undique ex Etruria auxilia convenerant, non tarn Veien—
tium gratia concitata quam, quod in spem ventum erat

discordia intestina dissolvi rem Romanam posse.
cipesque in omnium Etruriae populorum conciliis fre· ’

mebant aeternas opes esse RomanaS, nisi inter semet

ipsi seditionibus saeviant.

5. universi: as a body, without
regard to private relations—con·
salares: tle. particularly these, as
persons of importance, who would
be likely to have relatives and in·
fluence. - aliquid iuris, any claims
upon, business, social, or other. -——
gratia . . . auctoritate: a good ex-
ample of the difference between
these words, the first referring to
personal influence and popularity,
the second to that ,arising from
prominence in the community, and
somewhat political in its nature.—
obtinuere: belonging in sense also
with universi (patres), as appel-
lare also belongs with consulares,
but the Latin so loves an antithe-
sis that it makes one even where,
as here, the precise form of the
thought is disturbed by it; at the
same time, by the present arrange-

Id unum venenum, earn

ment, the main word is more closely
connected with consulareS,to which
it most belongs. -— salubres: in the
view of the aristocracy‚ to which
body any agitation on behalf os the
commons always seemed pernicious.
-vellent: sc. the tribunes implied
in ut cuique, ete.

6. novem: cf. 33. 2, where five
in all are mentioned, but Livy (or

his authority) is writing from a later n

point of view; or, as some think,
he wrote quattuor here, and novem
is due to a later hand—morato·
rem: cf. 43. 3.

7. quo: i.e. ad Veios, implied
in Veiens.

8. populorum: i.e. the different
cities, each independent, but undet
one league. —saeviantt the apod-
osis is aeternas . . . esse, which
contains in it a future idea; cf.
