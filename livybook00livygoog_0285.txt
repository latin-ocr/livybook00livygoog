LIVY.

Nemo ullius nisi s

Ita effuso agmine per stragem corpo-

rum armorumque evasere ut prius h‘ostis desisteret se-

qui quam Romanus fugere.

Tandem collectis ex dissi· 9

pato cursu militibus consul, cum revocando nequiquam
suos persecutus esset, in pacato agro castra posuit 3 ad-
vocataque contione invectus haud falso in proditorem

exercitum militaris disciplinae, desertorem signorum, ubi 10

signa, ubi arma essent, singulos rogitans, inermes mili-

tes, signo amisso signiferOS, ad hoc centuriones dupli· 11

cariosque qui reliquerant ordines, virgis caesos securi
percussit ; cetera multitudo sorte decimus quisque ad

supplicium lecti.-

Contra ea in Aequis inter consulem ac milites comi· 6⁰
tate ac beneficiis certatum est.

Et natura Quinctius

erat lenior et saevitia infelix collegae quo is magis gau-

deret ingenio suo effecerat.

8. ulliusz a substantive use of
this word unknown elsewhere ς cf.
eius, 47. 12.

9. revocando: ablative of man-
ner3 cf. sumendo, 32. 4. — advo·
cata: notice the emphasis, calling
the assembly, as he had originally
purposed. — invectus: sc. est.

10. inermes milites, etc: co·
ordinated (or in apposition) with
singulos, and so following rogi-
tan8‚ but containing the substance
guinis reproaches repeated chiasti-

ιι. ad hoca i.e. in addition to
his invective. - centuriones du·
plicariosque: as more trusted, and
so more res onsible for the treach-
ery. The paster were not exactly
officers, but soldiers who had re-
ceived a reward (double rations)
for previous valor, and so were in
ᾳ position os trust similar to that

Huic tantae concordiae a

of the centurions. —multitudo .. .
decimus . . . lecti: a curious con-
struction according to sense, ex-
plained by the partitive apposition
of quisque. -ad supplicium, χὴν
execution.

‘rma CAMPAIGN or Qumcrms,

60. et . . . et: the two branches
are the natural disposition of the
consul, and his profiting by the ex·
perience of his colleague. — quo
. . . gauderet: a rare construction
os a result clause with quo ,· cs. the
common quominus in such clauses.

2. concordiae, etc.: put by a
common Latin usage for duci, etc.,
tam concordibus. Though the lan-
guage is less fond of abstract nouns,
yet it sometimes prefers them as
summing up the quality referred to
in a single word, which is then by
its use made concrete again 3 cf. 1.
