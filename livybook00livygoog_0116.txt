superiorum regum belli pacisque et artibus et gloria par.
Iam filii prope puberem aetatem erant. Eo magis Tar-

courtier. —in . . . iura: tle. he raised
the mere acquaintance to an inti-
mate friendship. —expertusz pas·

35. iarn, by this time. —eo ma-
gis: because one of them might
claim the right to be elected, if
they were of age.—regi: see Gr.

299f b. — fierent: of course through ·

an mterrex.

2. tempus: set for the comitia.
— petisse ambitiose : to have can-
vassed (electioneered),as candidates
in later times. The whole story, as
it lies in Livy's mind, is derived from
the later republic, when the corn·
mons were all-powerful. —oratio-
nem: in a contio, when candidates
used to present their claims. —- eon-

ciliandos: cf. Aen. VI. 816.

3. cum: sc. memoraret, which
is forgotten in the long account of
the discourse, and picked up again
in another form in 6. The whole
passage is put in to explain com-
positam. —- rem novam 2 i.e. elec-
tion to the throne as a sti-anger.—
quisquam: the force of non con-
tinued through the whole occasions
the use of quisquam rather than
aliquis. The same idea excuses -ve
als0. - posset: potential present
thrown back into past time. The
rest of the discourse retains its time
(see Gr. 336. B, a), but this one
verb, on account of its being con-
trary to fact, goes into the imper·
fect. The close connection of the
potential subjunctive and the char·
acteristic construction is seen in
this clause (cf. Gr.319‚ head note).
The meaning is almost, ‘ So that
anybody could feel indignant at it’
(cf. quisquam and -ve).-igna·
