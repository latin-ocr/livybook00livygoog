4. actioni: the magistrate was
said agere cum populo. -- quae: re·
ferring to the ut clause,which, how·
ever, depends immediately on ad-
duci. — resistendum: Livy care-
lessly uses this word in a slightly
different sense from that of resis-
terent above, which only means
attempt to resist.—aliquis: this
should be properly the subject of
posset, but the sentence is confused
by the parenthetical relative clause.
It ought to read neque quisquam ut
intercederet adduci posset, quae una
vis, etc., but the parenthesis carries
with it the ut clause, and we have
aliquis and no subject for posset.
— tament again a slight confusion
of thought. The real idea is„ ‘ This
was a measure most agreeable to
the plebs, but the senate resisted,
and though they failed to secure
the only effectual means, yet in spite
of the zeal of the people and the

fact that no tribune could be won
over to stay proceedings, the im-
portance of the matter delayed it
for a whole year,’ i.e. beyond the
term of office os Publilius.—-mo-
limine gravia, dis cult from its
importance,· lit. ⁴ eavy from its
own weight.’

5. paternis: cf. 27. 1. — datur:
cf. 43. 11 n., and see the conduct
of Quinctius, ch. 15.

6. anni: naturally of the con·
sul’s term. — ut . . . sic: almost
equal to though . . . yet. The idea
is, ‘ But the struggle was with a
different adversary, though (while)
Volero was the inventor, yet (so
also) Laetorius was a champion, a
fresher and more energetic man, so
that he now takes the lead.5

7. ferocem, audacious,· confi·
dent and violent at the same time,
as is explained in the following. —
familiae, etc.: cf. Tac. Ann. 1. 4.
