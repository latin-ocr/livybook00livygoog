LIVY. ' 81

Sabini, haud parum memores et suarum virium par· 6
- tem Romae ab Tatio locatam et Romanam rem nuper
etiam adiectione populi⁴ Albani auctam, circumspicere
et ipsi externa auxilia. Etruria erat vicina, proximi 7

Etruscorum Veientes,

Inde ob residuas bellorum iras

maxime sollicitatis ad defectionem animis voluntarios
traxere, et apud vagos quosdam ex inopi plebe etiam
merces valuit ; publico auxilio nullo adiuti sunt, valuitque
apud Veientes—nam de ceteris minus mirum est —-
pacta cum Romulo indutiarum fides,

Cum bellum utrimque summa ope pararent vertique 8
in eo res videretur, utri prius arma inferrent, occupat

Tullus in agrum Sabinum transire.

Pugna atrox ad 9

Silvam Malitiosam fuit, ubi et peditum quidem robore,
ceterum equitatu aucto nuper plurimum Romana acies

valuit.

Ab equitibus repente invectis turbati ordines 10

sunt Sabinorum, nec pugna deinde illis constare nec
fuga explicari sine magna caede potuit.

6. suarum, etc.: i.e. that their
strength was diminished, and that
of the Romans increased.—-loca-
tam: cs. 13. 4.—et ipsi: aswell
as the Romans.

7. bellorum: i.e. previous wars.
The whole phrase belongs with sol·
licitatis. - defectionem: there
was only a truce, but Livy speaks
as if they were subjects. —volun·
tarios: their state of feeling was
such that persons were willing to
volunteer. — vagos, roving per-
sons, without lauded property. —
merces: i.e. these were gained by
. promise of pay. — publico, given
by any state as such, as opposed to
«private filibustering. -- valuit, was
qffectual. - valuit. held .- i.e. it re·
-strained the people of Veii, in spite
- of their hostile disposition. — nam:
ie. Ἰ speak of the VeienteS, for

the other Etruscans had no special
reason for hatred, and so it is not
surprising that they kept quiet! -
cum Romulo, etc.: cf. 15. 5.

8. verti in eo, turn on this
point. — occupat . . . transire,
hastens to get tlte star! in passing·
over.

9. et peditum, etc.= i.e. even in
this branch he was superior, but it
was especially with the cavalry that
he gained the advantage. — qui·
dem: opposed, as a concessive par-
ticle, to plurimum. — valuit: cf. 7.
Such repetition of a word in differ·

. ent phases of meaning is character·
,istic of Livy’s careless style.

10. pugna . . . constare, the
battle-line be maintained. —- fuga
(nom.) explicari, be opened out in
fingit! (changing the construction

·in English).
