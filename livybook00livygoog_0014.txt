Χ INTRODUCI'ION.

utterly incredible. Rome owes its importance, as all cities
do, to its geographical position. It commands the Tiber,
the only avenne to the interior for miles along the coast.
There can hardly be any doubt that a nomadic and later
agricultural people came down the peninsula from the North,
without any thought of communication by sea with any part
of the world. When the Greeks and Phoenicians ‘ discov-
ered ’ Italy, its inhabitants were in much the same situation
in regard to the rest of the earth as the North American
Indians at the discovery of America. What the foreigners
wanted was the raw materials which this wild country fur·
nished, and which were paid for by the products of civiliza-
tion. This foreign commerce seems to have lighted upon
Etruria first, as is indicated by the early importance of Caere
and other towns on or near the coast. Presently it attacked
the Tiber, and of this river the shepherds of the Palatine had
the command. Rome therefore became the entrepot‚ or at any
rate the toll-house, of Italian commerce. The earliest signifi-

 

cance of Rome is attached to the region along the Tiber, the ·

haunt of the merchants, where the Circus Maximus afterwards
stood (see I. 7. 3 n). The Palatine was of no importance
except as a stronghold to defend the traders (and probably
blackmailers), who could by means of it control all commerce
with the interior, whence the raw materials wanted by the
foreigners must come. Hence Rome, from being a station
of shepherdS, became a centre of commerce. The Sabines, a
kindred stock, were close by in the mountains, and wanted to
have their share in the foreign wealth. They took or had
already occupied, for the same purpose as the Latins (Albans),
other hills close by. After many contests they early became
united into one community with the Latins. In’ the course
of this development foreign influence made itself felt, probably
by permanent settlement rather than by merevcommercial inter·
course. Why Lavinium should have been selected as the point
around which the legends of foreign settlement should crys-
