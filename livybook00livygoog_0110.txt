24. 4 n. — dederunt: tle. the res ,-
solverunt: the lites,· fecerunt:
the causae: though the words
may possibly be used loosely in
legal verbiage, as we hardly know
the original meaning of causa. —
ei: the leading man in the senate.
— sententiam: see Gr. 239. 2. c.

1 2. puro pioque ι the two require-
ments of ‘ clean hands and a pure
heart’; i.e. a war whose cause is
just and whose methods are honest.
—duellox old form of bell0,· cf.
bis, from duo. —quaerendas: sc.
the res, etc. — consentio consci-

pression probably goes far back into
antiquity, when the vote of the war-
riors was necessary at the outset.
This Livy does not mention, perhaps
because it would be too democratic

for his conception of a kingdom. —
in . . . ibat: alluding to an actual
division of the house, such as was
practised in ancient times. — ferra-
tam: an iton-headed spear would
be a natural symbol of war. —san-
guineam: with a hasta pura, the
point would be hardened in the fite,
as was often customary sor warlike
weapons‚ and stained with blood to
complete the symbolism. — puberi-
bus ε aswitnesses. Thewhole must be
done in form, and capable of proof.

13. quod: the regular Latin
whereas, but it is properly the ob·
ject of the verbs. - eam rem: the
antecedent of q‘uod. — populus-
que: i.e. and through me the popu·
lus Romanus. — facio z by the hurl-
ing of the span—dixisset: sub·
junctive of repeated action; see Gr.
