3 Additae huic classi duae fabrum centuriae, quae sine
armis stipendia facerent; datum munus ut machinas in

quinque et septuaginta milium censum instituta, et ex iis,
senioribus iunioribusque, vig-inti conscriptae centuriae.

statement indicates that these were
not selected according to the cen-

as a sort of attinery.—maehinas:

armor. —verutumz a light dart,
not used as a lance, like the hasta,
but only for a missile. With the
hasta, however, they could form a

ess added (accensi) as orderliae
and other attendants, and may have,
with the musicians, made up the
three mentioned by Livy, being
counted in the fifth class. This
explanation makes sense of the first
passage, but contradicts 8. The
