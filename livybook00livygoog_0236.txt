ira prope armavit: farne se iarn sicut hostes peti, cibo
victuque fraudari ; peregrinum frumentum, quae sola
alimenta ex insperato fortuna dederit, ab ore rapi, nisi
Gnaeo Marcio vincti dedantur tribuni, nisi de tergo ple-
bis Romanae satisfiat. Eum sibi carnificem novum ex-
2 ortum, qui aut mori aut servire iubeat. In exeuntem
e curia impetus factus esset, ni peropportune tribuni
diem dixissent. Ibi ira est suppressa: se iudicem
quisque, se dominum vitae necisque inimici factum vi-
3 debat. Contemptim primo Marcius audiebat minas tri-
bunicias: auxilii non poenae ius datum illi potestati,
plebisque non patrum tribunos esse. Sed adeo infensa
erat coorta plebs ut unius poena defungendum esset
4 patribus. Restiterunt tamen adversa invidia, usique
sunt qua suis quisque, qua totius ordinis viribus, Ac
primo ’temptata res est, si dispositis clientibus abster-

the tribunes were later, but they
would hear of the speech3 cs. 111.
41. 4. — famez i.e. they were to be

unconstitutional. — sed, etc.: i.e.
the patricians were obliged to aban·
don the view held by the accused

 

starved out like a besieged city.
The figure is of hunger used as a
weapon (cf. spiculo petit, 20. 2) , but
is not felt very strongly.

2. diem dixissent: this is the
first instance of a capital trial in·
stituted by the tribunes. The as·
semblies of the people had jurisdic-
tion of such cases, and in order to
give a fair trial, the accusing magis·
trate announced that on a certain
day (diem dicere) he should bring
in a bill against the offender. The
charge against Coriolanus is not
given by Livy, and varies in other
writers, but it is impliedly his con·
duct in the senate.

3. auxilii, etc.: i.e. he claimed

that the power of the tribunes was “

only remedial, and that their pres·
ent action was, as we should say,

and consent to the trial.- defun-
gendum: the word· has the idea
of getting over something, having
done with it; here it means get rid
of the animosity of the plebs by sac-
rificing one of their number.

4. tamen, etc.: tle. though they
saw the necessity, yet they resisted
by political meanS, and made every
effort to aequit their champion on
the trial. — adversa invidia: in
spite os the odium of their course;
literally‚ ‘ facing it.' — suis: i.e. the
personal influence of themselves and
their dependents in political work-

temptata res est, siz„ cf. Ι. 57. 3.

of bullies and strikers to prevent
the political meetings os their op-
