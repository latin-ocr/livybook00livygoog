maximique secundum deorum opes imperii principium.
2 Vi compressa Vestalis cum geminum partum edidisset,
seu ita rata seu quia deus auctor culpae honestior erat,

Sed nec dii

nec homines aut ipsam aut stirpem a crudelitate regia
vindicant: sacerdos vincta in custodiam datur, pueros
in profluentem aquam mitti iubet.

Forte quadam divinitus super ripas Tiberis effusus
lenibus stagnis nec adiri usquam ad iusti cursum poterat
amnis et posse quamvis languida mergi aqua infantes

Ita velut defuncti regis imperio

in proxima adluvie, ubi nunc ficus Ruminalis est— Ro-

had a divine purpose which couldn't
be thwarted.

2. seu . . . seu: cf. 3. 33 notice
the less exact correspondence of
form in the two memberS, which be-
comes more common in the later
writers. —incertae : a euphemism;
dubious: of au uncertain father.—
nuncupat: cf. 3. 2 n.

3. dii: because Mars has been
mentioued above. —- homines:
merely added to give the idea, ‘ no
power, human or divine, can‚' etc.
—iubett naturally, the king. Livy
is not so careful as the earlier writ-
ers about changing the subject when
no ambiguity is to be feared.

4. forte quadam divinitus, it
happened provideatially. There is
no inconsistency in the expression
in Latin any more than in English.
Cf. also the Greek θείᾳ τινὶ τύχῃ. -
Tiberis: the subject of the whole.
—lenibus: i.e. in comparison with
the current in the channel.-nec

. . et, not . . . and at tlte same
time: the common set of cot-relatives
where one branchis negative and the
other affirmative. - ad iusti, etc. t an
explanatory phrase used loosely, as
if he had before said adire Tiberim,
like an English colloquial, ‘The fire

couldn’t be got at, to the centre of it.·
—iusti amnis, the river proper. ——
posse: emphatic3 that it was pos-
sible. The two ideas are, ‘They
couldn't get at the river bed, and
didn’t need to either.'—languida:
cf. lenibus above—infantes: i.e.
being mere babies, they might be
drowned in any pool. The word is
properly subject of mergi, but as so
often in Latin, is conceived as re-
peated with ferentibuS, where we
express a pronoun.—ferentibus:
cf. legentium, Pres. 4 n. —- dabat:
the subject is grammatically Tiberis
effusus, but logically the situation
indicated as far as stagnis. The
case differs from the common ones
of the sort in that Tiberis is used
first in its simple sense, and after-
wards in combination with effusus,
etc. It is to be remembered, how·
ever, that to the Romans Caesar
mortuus meant C cesar dead, even
when we are obliged to translate it
the death os Coesar.

5. velut, supposing that, etc.; cf.

. the common Latin use of tanquam,

and (rarely) ut,· see 54. 7. —de·
functi: i..e by so doing they had
done what they had been ordered.
—nunc. Ovid (F. 1L412) says
