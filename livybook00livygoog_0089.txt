Ad quorum casum cum conclamasset gaudio Albanus 6

-νιιΙι-ιοτι, etc. ε i.e. they could see
the strokes take effect. — duo Ro-
mani, etc.: the real main clause is
given in 63 but Livy stops in his
account of the situation to tell
the event of the duel& and re·
sumes the account with a cum
clause (ad quorum casum), and

gives the climax in exanimes, etc.

6. spes . . . cura: tle. they no
longer had any hope of the result,
but still had an anxious interest in
the fate of their surviving champion.
—vice unius: τῖε. in imagination
