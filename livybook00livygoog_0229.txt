LIVY.

Romanorum relictis castris, quae munitissimis tenue-
rant lociS‚ in aversas valles desiluere; ubi satis praedae

et victoria incruenta fuit.

207

Ita trifariam re bello bene gesta de domesticarum 7
rerum eventu nec patribus nec plebi cura decesserat:
tanta cum gratia turn arte praeparaverant faeneratores
quae non modo plebem sed ipsum etiam dictatorem fru-

’ strarentur.

tum omnium actionum in senatu primam habuit pro
victore popu10, rettulitque, quid de nexis fieri placeret.
Quae curn reiecta relatio esset, ‘Non placeo’ inquit. 9

‘ concordiae auctor.

Optabitis‚ me dius fidius, prope-

diem ut mei similes Romana plebes patronos habeat.
Quod ad me attinet, neque frustrabor ultra cives meos, ιο

neque ipse frustra dictator er0.

Discordiae intestinae,

bellum externum fecere ut hoc magistratu egeret res
publica;‘pax foris parta est, domi impeditur: privatus

potius quam dictator seditioni interer0.'

Ita curia

egressus dictatura se abdicavit. Apparuit causa plebi,

like. — aversas: cf. adversos montes
in 53 as the position was up-hill as
the Romans advanced, so the val·
leys were down-hill in the rear of
the Aequi.—ubi: loosely used of
the camp and the valleys at once.

7. trifariam: with the Aequi,
the Sabines, and the Volsci. — gra·
tia: personal influence; arte : secret
machinations. — quae, means to.

8. actionum, questions, about
which he consulted the senate.—
victore: i.e. by whose prowess the
victory had been gained. —— quid
. . . placeret: the standing formula
for presenting a question.

9. reiecta: i.e. the senate de-
clined to entertain the proposition
of the consul recommended in his
relatio ,· cf. reicerent, 22. 5. — non
placeo: the emphasis gives a force

which we get by using it seems or
forsooth. —mei similes: i.e. in·
stead of the much more dangerous
ones that they will have.

10. quod ad me, etc.: as if he
said, ‘ but that is your affair3 as sor
myself‚ 1 will,' etc. — frustra: a
play on the kindred words. — dis·
cordiae, etc.: i.e. there were two
purposes for which a dictator was
needed, to remove civil strife and to
carry on war; the latter has been
accomplished, the former is hin-
dered (as he implies) by the machi·
nations of citizens, so that the dicta·
tor is powerless. ·- interero: not, of
course, as a promoter, but to quell it.

11. apparuit: notice the 'empha-
sis, and see itaque below. — causa:
the reason of his action explained
by the following clause. — plebi:

Namque Valerius post Vetusi consulis redi· 8
