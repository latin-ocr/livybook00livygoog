mTRochrmN. · xiii

But in general he seems not to have done as even a rhetorician
might d0, made a special study of all, and then made an inde-
pendent account, but to have taken now one and now another
to follow for certain eventS, and then abandoned him for
some more attractive authority. The earliest events he has
drawn from the more simple accounts of Fabius, Piso, and
Tubero. For the next epoch, that of the beginning of the
Republic, he has⁴ followed Fabius, occasionally diverging to
some other annalist.

The change in his sources sometimes leads Livy into incon-
sistencieS. A case of this kind is found in this volume. At
Bk. II. chap. 21 he seems to abandon his authorities. and begin
chap. 22 from a new source. In doing this he displaces the
chronology, giving a new date to the battle of Lake RegilluS,
and repeating some of the events he has already narrated (cf.
17. 6 and 22. 2).

H1s QUALmEs As A NARRATOR.

8. If we disregard Livy's faults as a historian,— and for many-
purposes they may well be disregarded‚ —we shall recognize in
him a narrator whose skill amply justifies the estimation in which
from his own time till now he has been held. His work is a
narrative, and its truth or falsity makes no difference in his
talent. His power of imagination makes him, as it were, an
eyewitness of the scenes and events· He is filled with the
most appreciative sympathy for human motives and human
actionS, especially the more pathetic and the more noble. His
moral tone is lofty, without any trace of hypocrisy or cant. If
an event or situation is to be depicted, he knows how to seize
upon precisely the point of view which will give the most telling
effect. The form of narration and the language which he
selectS‚ though often careleSS, are always vivid and forcible‚
and bring the scenes before us with intense life and anima-
tion.
