possent? 1, lictor, conliga manus quae paulo ante ar-
matae imperium populo Romano pepererunt; i, caput
obnube liberatoris urbis huiuS, arbori infelici suspende,
verbera vel intra pomerium, modo inter illa pila et spolia
hostium, vel extra pomerium, modo inter sepulcra Curi-
atiorum. Quo enirn ducere hunc iuvenem potestis ubi
non sua decora eum a tanta foeditate supplicii vindi-
cent?'

Non tulit populus nec patris lacrimas nec ipsius
parem in omni periculo animum, absolveruntque admi-
ratione magis virtutis quam iure causae. Itaque, ut
caedes manifesta aliquo tamen piac-ulo lueretur, impera-
tum patri ut filium expiaret pecunia publica. Is qui-
busdam piacularibus sacrificiis factiS, ,quae deinde genti
Horatiae tradita sunt, transmisso per viam tigillo, capite
adoperto velut sub iugum misit' iuvenem. Id hodie quo-
que publice semper refectum manet3 Sororium tigillum
vocant.

constructum est ‚saxo quadrato.

lueretur: there was a stain of guilt
u on the state which had not been
⁴c eansed by any punishment of the
murder. This was to be removed by
an expiatory sacrifice, performed by
the father, but at the public expense.

13, genti: such private rites were
not uncommon at Rome, obligatory
upon a family or elan. — capite,
etc.= this was a symbolical sacrifice
