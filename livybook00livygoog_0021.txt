INTRonucrmN. xvii

In constructions we may notice:

r. The imperfect and pluperfect subjunctive in repeated action
— a growth of the times: e.g., ubi dixisset, I. 32. 13 ; si adesset,
11. 58. 7.

s. The more free use of the infinitive instead of clauses.
See I. 4. 9.

t. The indicative with quamvis, forsitan, ete. See II. 40. 7.

u. The free use of the dative — a more picturesque and
poetic construction: eg„ with absonus, Ι. 15. 6. See d (2),
above. '

v. The free use of the ablative of manner for more exact
modifiers: e.g., periculo, 1. 12. 10.

w. Particles with participial phrases instead of a clause: eg„
velut, I. 14. 8.

x. It is more in arrangement than anything else that Livy
differs from other prose writers, His narrative is not so much
to inform the intellect as to excite the imagination. Hence he
does not affect the finely balanced periods of Cicer0, though
. periodic structure is almost inseparable from Latin 3 but with a
skilful use of all the means of co-‘ordination and subordination,
he presents a picture, stroke after stroke, with the proper
emphasis to give its proper prominence to each detail, often'
leaving the grammar to take care of itself. In the skill with
which he uses the position of the single words in a clause to
produce these effectS, he is unequalled (see I. 17. 4 3 II. 2 5. 3).
It is impossible for us to get the effect he intends to produce
without noticing the position of every word. Indeed, he some-
times for effect gives artificial and forced emphasis, which
produces the effect, to be sure, but at the sacrifice of sim-
plicity (see I. 11. 6).

Which of these or what other peculiarities of style gave rise
to Asinius Pollio's charge ofpatavinizy (provincialism), nobody
has ever satisfactorily determined. But whatever the crime
waS‚ we may well forgive him, being sure that it can be nothing

very bad.
