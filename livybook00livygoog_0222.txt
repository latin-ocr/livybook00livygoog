LIVY.

[Boox 11.

Correpti consuleS,

cum, quid ergo se facere vellent, nihil enim segnius
molliusve quam patribus placeat acturos, percunctaren-
tur, decernunt ut dilectum quam acerrimum habeant;
6 otio lascivire plebem. Dimisso senatu consules in tri-

bunal escendunt; citant nominatim iuniores·

Cum ad

nomen nemo responderet, circumfusa multitudo in con-
7 tionis modum negare ultra decipi plebem posse ; num-
quam unum militem habituros, ni praestaretur fides
publica3 libertatem unicuique prius reddendam esse
quarn arma danda, ut pro patria civibusque, non pro

8 dominis pugnent.

Consules quid mandatum esset a

senatu videbant, sed eorum qui intra parietes curiae
ferociter loquerentur nerninem adesse invidiae suae
participem} et apparebat atrox cum plebe certamen.
ο Prius itaque quam ultima experirentur, senatum iterum

consulere placuit.

5. correpti: i.e. feeling rebuked.
—vellent . . . placeat: see Gr. 336.
B. a. N. 1.—decernunt: sc. the
senate. — acerrimum ε a word often
applied to a levy without the allow-
ance of excuses», and rigidly en-
forced.

6. tribunal: a raised platform in
the Forum, where magistrates exer·
cised their mnesteus—citant: as
opposed to the general order, to
which ordinarily the people would
respond by giving in their names
(nomina dare). Here they are in-
dividually summoned. — contionis z
i.e. the crowd was like a general
meeting of the people summoned
by a magistrate. —· negare: this
word, in its emphatic position, rep-
resents an¹ emphatic negative; cf.
non, 23. 7, and nunquam below.

7. unum: emphatic, a sin le.—

graestaretur: for praestetur f the
irect.

Tum vero ad sellas consulum prope

8. quid, etc.: a good example
of the variable order (and empha-
sis) of the Latin. If videbant had
come first, as it well might, the sense
would be ‘they were well aware, but
did not act in accordance with the
knowledge! Here it is, ‘they knew
the orders of the senate as a body,
but they also saw that no one of
the senators themselves came per-
sonally to bear the brunt of the
fight.’ —suaet i.e. of the consuls.
Politics were much the same in an-
cient as in modern times, and our
newspapers are as good a com·
ment on Livy's account as could be
desired.—et apparebat: the con·
nection of thought is, ‘and there
was good reason why they did not
show themselves, sor in fact it was
evident that there would be a vio·
lent contest with the lower orders.’

9. itaque: in Livy often in the
second place. — ultima, extreme
