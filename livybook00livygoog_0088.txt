66 LIVY. [Boot 1.

25 Foedere icto trigemini sicut convenerat arma capiunt.
Cum sui utrosque adhortarentur, deos patrios, patriam
ac parenteS, quidquid civium domi, quidquid in exercitu
sit, illorum tunc arma, illorum intueri manuS, feroces et
suopte ingenio et pleni adhortantium vocibus in medium

2 inter duas acies procedunt. Consederant utrimque pro
castris duo exercitus, periculi magis praesentis quam
curae expertes ; quippe imperium agebatur in t-am pauco-
rum virtute atque fortuna positum. Itaque ergo erecti
suspensique in minime gratum spectaculum animo in-
tenduntur.

3 Datur signum infestisque armis, velut acieS, terni
iuvenes, magnorum exercituum animos gerenteS‚ concur·

imperium servitiumque obversatur animo futuraque ea

THE CoMBA‘r.

25. sui: see Gr. 196. c.—deos
patrios, etc.: the words used by the

bearing was like that of two trained
hosts in battle array, in which the
tactics are unisorm, as, for instance,

encouraging partisanS. Translate,
Each accompanied by the exhorta·
tions of their countrymen, who said
mat, etc. — illorumz representing
the emphatic vestra in the direct.
—et . . . et: the two ideas are the
natural spirit of the young men and
the enthusiasm superinduced by the
adjurations of their friends. —pleni,
etc„ filled with enthusiasm from, etc.

2. consederant, were stationed,-
see Gr. 279. e. R.-curae, anxiezy
(sor the future), as opposed to the
present immediate danger. — im-
perium, supremacy. — agebatur,
etc„ was staked upon. — erecti
suspensique: cf. Cic. Brutus, 200.

3. infestis armis, in hostile·
army. The words had originally
a definite literal meaning which was
merged in the more general one.—
velut acies: i.e. their attitude and

in a line of bayonets at charge or of
levelled lances. —temiz i.e. three
on each side. —animos ε expressing
their courageous spirit as the pre-
ceding expresses their outward ap·
pearance. — publicum, of their na·
tion ‚· opposed to suum, and by the
antithesis supplying the want of a
connective. — obversatur, etc.: it
was such moral effects as‘this that
especially interested Livy in his his·
tory, and, indeed, the Romans of all
times. — futura, etc.‚ and the thought
that such would be, etc. This com-
pression of an idea into a noun with
a participle is characteristic of the
Latin; see Gr. 292. a‚an,d p. 314,
footnote. The fondness sor such
expressions increases much in im-
perial times—fecissent: subjunc-
tive of indirect discourse standing

for future perfect. See Gr. 341· c.
