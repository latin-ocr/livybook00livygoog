CHAPS. 39, 4o.] LIVY.

Dein familiarium quidam, qui insignem maestitia inter 4
ceteras cognoverat Veturiam inter nurum nepotesque
stantem, ‘Nisi me frustrantur’ inquit ‘ oculi, mater tibi
coniunxque et liberi adsunt.' Coriolanus prope ut amens 5
consternatus ab sede sua curn ferret matri obviae com-
plexum, mulier in iram ex precibus versa ‘Sine, prius-
* quam complexum accipi0, sciam’ inquit ‘ad hostem an
ad filium venerim, captiva materne in castris tuis sim.
In hoc me longa vita et infelix senecta traxit, ut exsulem 6
te, deinde hostem viderem ? Potuisti populari hanc ter-
ram, quae te genuit atque aluit? Non tibi, quamvis in· 7
festo animo et minaci perveneras, ingredienti fines ira
cecidit? Non, cum in conspectu Roma fuit, succurrit
‘Intra illa moenia domus ac penates mei sunt, mater,
coniunx liberique'? Ergo ego nisi peperissem, Roma 8
non oppugnaretur; nisi filium haberem, libera in libera

course the women generally. — pos·
sent: the thought of the women.
3. publica: i.e. of the state.
5. consternatus, springing wild-
ly, indicating the frenzied start from

7. non: the emphatic position
of the negative gives the force, ‘ it
seems incredible that it did not.’
—quamvis: this word, in classical
Latin, from its meaning always takes

his place at the news—in iram,
ete.: z’.e. she had come to suppli-
cate, but at the sight of her son her
feelings change, and she meets him
with stern reproaches — accipio:
the present for the future, an almost
regular construction with ante and
priusquam in colloquial language.
— sciam: see Gr. 331. s R. —
captiva. if he was an enemy, then
she, being' m his power, was a slave,
instead of having the authority of a
mother.

6. in hoc, to this, though the
Latin uses a stronger expression by
means of traxit, as if, ‘ dragged me
into this condition. ’ — potuisti: the
emphasis gives the force of‘ could
‚you bring yourself to?' Cf. Hor.
Od. 111. 11. 31. Notice, also, the
emphasis on populari.

the subjunctive, but beginning with
the omission of the verb, which
would be in that mood if expressed,
the construction comes to allow the
indicative, as if etsi or the like had
been used ; here quamvis infesto
animo, with another conditional
particle would be regular, and Livy
forgets, as it were, that no such
particle or any verb has been ex·
pressed, and goes on as if he had
said, etsi quamvis infesto animo per-
veneras.

8. ergo: introducing, as often,
a conclusion from all the circum·
stances not immediately connected
with the preceding. 1t is to be
remembered that Livy is, first of
all, a rhetorician‚ and these occa·
sions are his opportunities for show-
ing his skill in speech-making.—
