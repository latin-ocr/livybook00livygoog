have been but a meagre field for a patriotic rhetorician, and so
we have, fortunately perhaps, the received accountS, full of
poetry, legend, and materials for national pride.

6. Naturally Livy's history is none of it the result of original '

research. His authorities are the historians and antiquaries who ‘

had come before him. These are chiefly, especially for the
early books contained in this volume ε -

Q. Fabius Pictor (cited by him as Fabius), who wrote in
Greek the story of the Second Punic War, of which he was a
contemporary, with an introduction treating of the earliest timeS,
no doubt strongly colored by the family pride of the Fabii.

· L. Cincius Alimentus, who covered the same ground, lived
about the same time, and also wrote in Greek.

L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi (cited as Piso), consul 133 13.c.,
who waS, perhaps, the most eminent of the authorities con-
sulted. This author combined with his annals accounts of
early customs and institutionS.

Valerius Antias, who had written a history of the city from
its foundation. It appears to have been less trustworthy, how-
ever, than the other works used by Livy, and more highly col-

, ored by family pride even than that of Fabius.

C. Licinius Macer, tribune 73 13.c., who wrote as a partisan
of the plebs in their conflict with the aristocracy.

Q. Aelius Tuber0, contemporary with Cicero and known to
us as the opponent of LigariuS, who wrote a history from the
earliest times down to the Civil WarS.

For the later books lli-Porcius Cata, the censor, L. Caelius
Antipater, a contemporary of the Gracchi, Q. Claudius Quad—
ngran’us, L. Cornelius Sisenna, praetor 78 13.c., Polybius, the
Greek, and many otherS, contributed materials for our author’s ·
use.

7. In his treatment of these authorities Livy naturally varies
much, according to the nature of the events to· be narrated.
