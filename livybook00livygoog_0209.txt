mano esset, et maturavit RomanuS, ne proelio uno cum
Latino Volscoque contenderet. Hac ira consules in 2
Volscum agrum legiones duxere. Volscos consilii poe-
nam non metuentes necopinata res perculit. Armo-
rum immemores obsides dant trecentos principum a
Cora atque Pometia liberos: ita sine certamine inde
abductae legiones. Nec ita multo post Volscis levatis 3
metu suum rediit ingenium: rursus occultum parant
bellum Hernicis in societatem armorum adsumptis;
legatos quoque ad sollicitandum Latium passim dimit· 4
tunt. Sed recens ad Regillum lacum accepta clades
Latinos ira odioque eiuS, quicumque arma suaderet, ne
ab legatis quidem violandis abstinuit. Comprehensos
Volscos Romam duxere. Ibi traditi consulibuS, indica-

‘they had got together forces to
send (and would have sent), had
not‚' etc. - maturavit, etc.: the
reason why theie was not war, —
the Romans were too quick for
them.

2. hac ira: cf. 1. 30.4n. Livy's
account (cf. 21. 1) makes a four
years’ interval from the battle of
Lake Regillus to these events. But
he is evidently now following the
other account to which he alludes
(21. 3), and so connects the events
immediately with the Latin war. —
consilii, 0 their course ,· name-ly,
in aiding t e Latins. — necopinata
res: i.e. as they had no fear of
punishment, the sudden appearance
of the Romans overwhelmed them.
— armorum immemor-ea, without
thinking of resistance. — Pometia:
this had been already destroyed,
according to Livy’s account (17.
6), but now reappears as a city of
the Volsci3 cf. 25. 6. —aCoraz cf.
ab Aricia, 1. 50. 311.

3. nec, and yet nota-levatis:
as sear casts down, so freedom from
it lifts up; cf. perculit, 2.—-suum
. . . ingenium: i.e. their native war·
like and hostile disposition, which
had been held in check for the mo-
ment by their sear. ——occultumz
emphatic, as opposed to their open
warfare before. — Hernicis: a
mountain people counted as be-
longing to Latium, but not politi·
cally included with them.

4. legatos: emphatic, as opposed
to their actual arrangement with the
Hernici. — quoque: belonging to
the whole sentence, but, as usual,
placed after the emphatic word:
‘they took in the Hernici, and sent
also to Latium, but without success)
— recens, etc.: a somewhat con-
fused way of saying that the Latius,
from anger, etc„ caused by the mem·
ory of the late disaster, did not re·
frain, etc.; the disaster itself being
put for the Latius who were think·
ing of it.
