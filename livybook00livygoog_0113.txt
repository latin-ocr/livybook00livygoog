:Demarati Corinthii filius erat, qui ob seditiones domo η
profugus curn Tarquiniis forte consedisset, uxore ibi
ducta duos filios genuit. Nomina his Lucumo atque
Arruns fuerunt. Lucumo superfuit patri bonorum om-
nium heres3 Arruns prior quam pater moritur, uxore

qui cum, ignorans nurum ventrem ferre, immemor in
testando nepotis decessisset, puero, post avi mortem in
nullam sortem bonorum nat0, ab inopia Egerio inditum

divitiae iam animos facerent, auxit ducta in matrimonium

patriam caritatis dummodo

2. ob seditiones ι at every change
of government accomplished or at-
tempted in the Greek cities, there>
were always more or less persons
exiled.-heres: in predicative ap-
position. —relictaz the ablative ab·

solute becomes so purely an adver-

bial expression, that the idea of past
time in the perfect participle often
entirely disappears.

3. Egerio: as if from egeo.

4. iam ε i.e. without the additional
stimulus of a high-born wife. — an-
imos, pride ,· a common meaning

Introd. 9. e. -- Tanaquil: apparently
not a proper name in Etruscan,
but a title like Lucumo3 a fact

which agrees with the legendary
character of the whole story. -2-

virum honoratum videret,

et quae: i.e. not only did the fact
of the marriage act upon the mind
of Lucumo, but the ambition of the
woman herself was calculated to
excite him. — sineret: characteris·
tic subjunctive, not in its fully de-

cf. Gr. 319, headnote.—quo, into
which ,· see Gr. 201. s — innup-
sisset: partaking of the character
of sineret, and hence agreeing with
it in mood (Gr. 342); cf. nata
erat, which does not partake of
this character.

5. spernentibus: i.e. refusing
social recognition as one of the
ruling caste. —- exsule advena : see
Gr. 188* d, and cf. pastor accola,
7. 5. —potuitz i.e. Tanaquil; we
should expect an illa or haec, but
it is carelessly ominem—fideret:
