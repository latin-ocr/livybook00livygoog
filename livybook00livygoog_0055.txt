would expect parentes rapta·

before. -tum maxime, at that

themselves were reconciled.—sor·
dida veste= the usual sign of
mourning with the ancients, as·

flocking,' etc.—-regem: apparently
ruling only in Cures, but exercising
a general control over the Sabine
stock.—legationes: i.e. officially
from these stateS.

sufficient vigor.
