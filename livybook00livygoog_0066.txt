9 locum insidiarum.

Inde subito exorti Romani transver-

sam invadunt hostiurn aciem. Addunt pavorem mota

e castris signa eorum qui in praesidio relicti fuerant.

Ita

The ultimate result takes the place
of main clause; but the vivid details
succeed each other in the order of
time or natural presentation, and
make a picture by a succession of
strokes. This is Livy's special art or
artless charm. He is always making
pictureS, and they must be observed
as he draws thern, stroke aster stroke.

9. transversam, on the flank.
The quality properly belongs ad-
verbially to the Roman attack, but it
is transferred in Latin to the enemy,
for, of course, each was transversa
to the omen—addunt pavorem,
a new alarm is added by, etc.—
mota‚ etc.: i.e. the guard of the
camp marches out in battle ari-ay, as
if to re-enforce the Romans. — rnul-
tiplici‚ from many quarters. — qui-
que, ete„ and tlte horsemen who were
with him. These are mentioned
because the movement of the horse
would be quicker, and hence there
is no need to speak of the foot.—
circumagerent, could wheel: cf.
esset, 4 n, and see Gr. 327.

10. effusius: τῖε. than the Ro-
mans had before. —veraz as op-
posed to the pretended flight of the
Romans, —simulantes (acc.)‚ the
pretended fugitives.

11. non: the emphasis mayberen-
dered by even so . . . not. —- haerens,
etc.: the picture is Such as would
be given by hanging close on their
rear came the Romans, and, etc.—
fores: i.e. the gates themselves as
barriers; portarum: the whole
aperture. — obicerentur: see Gr.

327·
wan wrm VE11.

15· beni= the emphasis gives
an effect like tlte war with Fidenoe
excited the Veientes alto to war. --
ct consanguinitate: parallel with
et quod, which gives another rea-
son for the excited minds of the
Veientes. — propinquitas: about
a dozen miles off. — si, etc.: a
protasis to an apodosis implied in
propinquitas, like, (which would δυ
very near) in case, ete. ·
