excellentibus ingeniis citius defuerit ars qua civem

11 regant quam qua hostem superent. Consul Romam
rediit non tam belli gloria aucta quam inritato exacer-
batoque in se militum odio. Obtinuere tamen patres
ut in Fabia gente consulatus maneret : M. Fabium con·
sulem creant, Fabio collega Gnaeus Manlius datur.

44 Et hic annus tribunum auctorem legis agrariae -ha-
buit: Ti. Pontificius fuit. Is eandem viam, velut pro-
cessisset Sp. Licinio, ingressus dilectum paulisper im-

2 pediit. Perturbatis iterum patribus Appius Claudius
victam tribuniciam potestatem dicere priore ann0, in
praesentia re, exemplo in perpetuum, quando inventum

3 sit suis ipsam viribus dissolvi. Neque enim umquam
defuturum qui et ex collega victoriam sibi et gratiam
melioris partis bono publico velit quaesitam ; et plureS,

with succedere, and occasionally
gith3 1tlziis word. For mood, see -

the Romans even more famous as
statesmen and politicians than as
generals and warriors 3 but one could

hardly expect the civil virtues to

flourish as early as the military. ·— Α

defuerit: see Gr. 311. b.

11. gloria aucta, etc.: these ab-
latives absolute have all the force of
ablatives of quality. ln fact, the Ro·
mans were not so particular about
classifying the uses of cases as it is
convenient for us to be. -obtinu-
ere: cf. tenuere, 42. 2. — collega
. . . datur: in these cases (cf. 42.
2 and 43. 1) the patricians suc-
ceeded in forcing one of their par-
tisans on the elective body, but were
obliged to allow one consul to the
supporters of the plebeians; hence
the word datur.

THE PATRICIANS AGAIN mva
THE TRIBUNES. HOPEs OF THE
ETRuscANS.

44. eandem: ie. as Licinius,
explained in the next clause. —
processisset: impersonal, as often

2. victam, etc.: the emphasis
gives the force, ‘the method pro-
posed succeeded the last time, why
not try it again?’ Cf. iri prae·
sentia re and its chiastic antithesiS.
‘not only effectuany for the mo-
ment, but so as to suggest it again
in any similar circumstances! —
dicere: not very different from
dixit, but giving more the idea of
‘proceeded to suggest,' or ‘it oe-
curred to Appius to suggest,’ as a
part of the situation; cf. the fur·
ther description of the situation and
the final action (obtinuere, etc.) in 5.

3. ex collega: corresponding
chiastically with melioris partis.
— melioris: the emphasis is caused
by the fact that the tribune himself
belonged, in the view of the speaker,
to the worse part. — bono: used
as a substantive, like pessimo in
1· 3. — quaesitam: cf. quaesita,

43. 10.
