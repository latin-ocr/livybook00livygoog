[Book 1.

Nec deinde Aborigines Troianis studio ac

fide erga regem Aeneam cessere; fretusque his animis
coalescentium in dies magis duorum populorum AeneaS,
quamquam tanta opibus Etruria erat ut iam non terras
solum, sed mare etiam per totam Italiae 'longitudinem
ab Alpibus ad fretum Siculum fama nominis sui imples-
set, tamen, cum moenibus bellum propulsare posset, in

6 aciem copias eduxit.

Secundum inde proelium LatiniS,

Aeneae etiam ultimum mortalium operum fuit. Situs est,
quemcumque eum dici ius fasque est, super Numicum
fluvium, Iovem indigetem appellant.

tamen id imperium ei ad puberem aetatem incolume

difference of name there was a lack
of common national feeling which
was now secured.

5. ac. the ideas are closely united,
where aut would separate them.

fretus. the emphasis gives the
idea‚‘ And such was his confidence,
etc„ that he did not sbrink from the
contest, and that, too, in the open
field! — his animis: τῖε. studio
ac fide in both classes. — coale-
scentium: this to us awkward com-
pression of a relative clause into a
participle is characteristic of post-
Ciceronian Latin. It emphasizes
the meaning of the participle. -iarnz
notice the force of ⁸ coming t0,’
‘getting t0,' or the like, which is
always present in this word—cum:
introducing a new subordinate con·
cession. —bellum, the enemy, or
the invasion ,· cf. belli above (4).

6. secundum, etc.: as if it were
‘ Then there was a battle in which the
victory tested with the Latins; but
for their commander it was,' etc. Itis
only by following Livy’s unexpressed
thought, as shown by the order, that
the sense of his words can be made
¹ out. — Latinis: Livy follows poetic

usage in the very free use of the
dative of possession or reference.
— operum. not exactly deeds, nor
tozls, but something between, say
e.orts —situs est, his grave is,-
t e regular expression on tomb-
stones. The disappearance which is
implied is not expressed definitely3
cf. Pref. 7. —quemcumque, etc.=
i.e. whether god, her0, or man.
super, on the bank osi—Numi-
curn: a little stream south of La-
vinium. — indigetem, local, as tute-

'lary divinity of a single place, to

which he is supposed to be native.
Likely enough the worship of AEneas
is confused with that of the river
god Numicus. Cf. Dionysius, Ι. 64;
Tib. ΙΙ. 5. 43: —

Illic sanctus eris cum te veneranda Numici
Vnda deum caelo miserit indigetem.

8. maturus: the emphasis means
something like ‘ His natural succes·
sor wasn’t old enough yet to take
Itis place, but the place was kept
safe for him till he was,' or ‘the
youth of AEneas' son prevented his
