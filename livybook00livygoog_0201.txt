Romam inde male gesta re redi· 4
Inter multos saucios consul spe incerta vitae
Interiecto deinde haud magno spatio, quod

vulneribus curandis supplendoque exercitui satis esset,
cum ira maiore bellurn tum viribus etiarn auctis Pome-

tiae arma inlata.

Et cum vineis refectis aliaque mole 5

belli iam in eo esset ut in muros evaderet miles, deditio
est facta. Ceterum nihilo minus foeda dedita urbe 6

quarn si capta foret Aurunci passi:

principes securi

percussi, sub corona venierunt coloni alii; oppidum

lent to ‘the consuls of the next
year. '—vi, ete.. cf. Ι. 57. 3.

2. in quoa. referring to consule&
but including, of course, the whole
force. — iarn: i.e. the time had
gone by for any hope of successful
resistance, and nothing remained
but to satisfy their hatred. —ali·
qua: one would expect ulla, the
negative pronoun‚ on account of
the negative force of magis quam,
but aliquis is often thus used; cf.
2. 2, aliquid: see Gr. 202. b and c.
— cuncta complent, spread every·
where.

3. hostium: speaking from the
point of view of the Aurunci.—
alterum, one qs the nvo, as often.
— ceterum, kmvever.

4. vulneribuS, etc.: see Gr. 299.
—bellurnt the word is doubtful;
if retained it covers nearly the same
ground as arma, but is more ab·
straet as connected with ira, the
spirit of the war, while arma refers

to viribuS, the actual means of
fighting.

5. in eo esset, etc., the soldzers
were on the point, etc.; an imper·
sonal construction with the result
clause, which may be looked upon
as its subject, though ut has eo for
its antecedent. — evaderet: τῖε.
from the agger, or the towers, raised
as high as the top of the walls.

6. foeda, a horrible fate.—de-
dita, etc„ though they had surren-
dered, ete. - Aurunci: this must
refer chiefly to the people of Po·
metia and Cora.- principes, etc.:
this may be merely a repetition of
the story· in 16. 9, but Livy evi·
dently takes it as a different one.
—sub corona: cf. Aul. Gell. VI.
4, antiquitus mancipia iure belli
capta coronis induta veniebant et
idcirco dicebantur ‘sub corona ' ve-
nire.—- coloni alii : Livy apparently

*treats all the inhabitants as if they

were colonists.
