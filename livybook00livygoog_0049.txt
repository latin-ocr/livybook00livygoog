clitae ea loca incolebant, factum. Forte ita evenit, ut 13
Potitii ad tempus praesto essent hisque exta apponeren-
tur, Pinarii extis adesis ad ceteram venirent dapem.
Inde institutum mansit, donec Pinarium genus fuit, ne

extis sollemnium vescerentur.

antistites sacri eius per multas aetates fuerunt, donec
tradito servis publicis sollemni familiae ministerio genus

omne Potitiorum interiit.

Haec tum sacra Romulus 15

una ex omnibus peregrina suscepit, iam tum immortali-
tatis virtute partae, ad quam eum sua fata ducebant,

fautor.

Rebus divinis rite perpetratis vocataque ad concilium 8
multitudine, quae coalescere in populi unius corpus nulla
re praeterquam legibus poterat, iura dedit ; quae ita 2

13. exta: as particularly sacred,
the beart, liver, etc. To this day,
in Greece, these parts of the lambs,
roasted whole on Easter Sunday,
are treated as special dainties; and
the editor, as a stranger, has had
them presented to him on such an
occasion.—dapem: it is to be re·
membered that every sacrifice in
ancient times, except those to the
gods beloW, was a feast. Cf. for the
whole matter Aen. VIII. 179 seq. -
donec Pinarium, etc.: apparently
this family became extinct first.

14. antistites: i.e. for the min·
isterium above mentioned. -- tra·
dito: i.e. they abandoned the
actual performance of the rites to
slaves, and, thereby committing a
religious offence, they as a conse·
quence died out.‘——publicis: to
every worship were attached certain
slaves who were considered the prop-
erty of the divinity or of the com·
monwealth. In this case, instead
of being only assistants, they were
allowed to perform all the rites, and
hence the pollution and consequent
guilt of the Potitii. See IX. 29. 9.

15. tum: i.e. this is the only for·
eign rite that dates back from time
immemorial. Very many other for-
eign rites were afterwards intro·
duced. -· fautor: this explains the
adoption by Romulus of this partic-
ular foreign rite. As destined him·
self to follow the example of Her·
cules, he had a fellow·feeling for the
hero, mentioned by Livy as a kind
of omen or inspired consciousnesS.

THE ConsnTuSTon or· THE NEw
TATE.

8. divinis, etc.: attended to first
according to the order of business
taken in the senate; cf. rite⁴(in due

orm). — ad concilium : not a legis·
ative assembly, but a contio to hear
his determination. Cf. 6. 2.——-cor·
pus: i.e. an organized common·
wealth.—1egibus: including the
whole constitution. — iura: not
differing from legibus, but used
for variety. — dedit: as king
without the action of the commu·
nit .
