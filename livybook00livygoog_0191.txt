CHAPs. 1 1, 12.] LIVY. 169

Abdito intra vestem ferro proficiscitur. Vbi eo venit, in 6
confertissima turba prope regium tribunal constitit. Ibi 7
cum stipendium militibus forte daretur, et scriba cum
rege sedens pari fere ornatu multa ageret, eum milites
vulgo adirent, timens sciscitari uter Porsinna esset, ne
ignorando regem semet ipse aperiret quis esset, quo te-
mere traxit fortuna facinuS, scribam pro rege obtruncat.
Vadentem inde, qua per trepidam turbam cruento mu· 8
crone sibi ipse fecerat viam, cum concursu ad clamorem
facto comprehensum regii satellites retraxissent, ante tri-
bunal regis destitutus tum quoque inter tantas fortunae
minas metuendus magis quam metuenS, ‘ Romanussum' 9
inquit ‘civiS, C. Mucium vocant. Hostis hostem occi·
dere volui, nec ad mortem minus animi est quam fuit ad
caedem: et facere et pati fortia Romanum est. Nec 10
unus in te ego hos animos gessi3 longus post me ordo
est idem petentium decus, Proinde in hoc discrimen, si

inter tantas, etc.: an explanation
of tum.-metuendus, an object

offear.

9. Romanus: by his very name

7. stipendium: Livy has in his
mind the payment of Roman troops
by the quaestor; hence pari or-
natu, as the quaestor was also a

magistrate as well as the consul. —-
sciscitari: an extension of the prin·
ciple stated, Gr. 271 (example 3). —
semet . . . quis esset: see Gr. 334.
c.—temere: i.e. he struck at a
venture, one being as likely to be
the king as the other.

8. qua per trepidam, etc.: i.e.
by the natural shrinking of the
crowd from an apparently desper-
ate man who had just committed
a murder. — concursu, etc.: i.e.
the rush of outsiders in greater
numbers who had not been para-
lyzed by the occurrence. —destitu-
tus, set domm-but with an idea of
being left alone without any pros-
pect of help. —tum quoque: i.e.
even under these circumstances. -

declaring himself an enemy without
any prevarication. ——fortia: to be
taken in two different senses with
the two verbs, but the subjective
and objective distinction was very
dim to the Romans.

10. nee unus, etc., and I am
not the only one, etc.; an effect pro·
duced by the emphasis.- animos:
not merely ‘purpose' or ‘design,'
but with an idea of boldness or
daring3 cf. I. 56. 7.— proinde: the
regular illative particle when its
clause is hortatory. -in hoc discri-
men: not merely ‘prepare for this
struggle,’ but ‘this is the struggle
you must prepare for,² as is indi·
cated by the emphasis as well as by
the explanatory ut clause; cf. also
