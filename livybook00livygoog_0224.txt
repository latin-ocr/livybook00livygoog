prendere prohibite, cum conversus in patres impetus
esset, consulum intercursu rixa sedata est, in qua tamen
sine lapide, sine telo plus clamoris atque irarum quam
iniuriae fuerat. Senatus tumultuose vocatus tumultuo-
sius consulitur, quaestionem postulantibus iis qui pulsati
fuerant, decernente ferocissimo quoque non sententiis
magis quam clamore et strepitu. Tandem cum irae re-
sedissent, exprobrantibus consulibus nihilo plus sanita-
tis in curia quam in foro esse, ordine consuli coepit.
Tres fuere sententiae. P. Verginius rem non vulgabat:
de iis tantum, qui fidem secuti Publi Servili consulis
Vulsc0, Aurunoe, Sabinoque militassent bello, agendum
censebat. Titus Larcius non id tempus esse ut merita
tantummodo exsolverentur; totam plebem aere alieno
demersam esse, nec sisti posse ni omnibus consulatur;

plus, etc. - nihil aliud: see Gr.
238. b.

5. tumultuose: a kind of play
on the word. The first time it means
hastily, without the usual formalities,
as in a tumultus; the second time
it refers to the disorder in the
meeting‚ which was a tumultus (cf.
28. 2 n). -quaestionemz i.e. an
investigation and consequent punish·
ment of the tioters. The latter had
maltreated senators and resisted offi-
cials in the discharge of their duties.
— decernente, etc.: i.e. the violent
members voted not so much by the
orderly expression of their sententiae
as by a disorderly clamor, impliedly
in favor of the investigation.

6. exprobrantibus, etc.: indicat·
ing what brought the angry senators
to their senses, the taunting accu-
sation that they were as mad as the
populace.— coepit (see Gr. 143. a) z
Weissenborn acutely remarks that
coeptum est would refer to the ac·
tion proceeding from the consuls,

whereas this means that the senate
itself came to order, Perhaps all
Livy's violations of the rule of coepit
and coeptum est can be explained
in like manner.

7. sententiaeg the senators gave
their opinions in order as called
upon, either proposing some new
course or agreeing with some one
who had already spoken. In this
case there were three different views,
with which the others agreed ac·
cording to their character and dis·
position. — rem non vulgabat: τῖε.
he proposed that the relies should
not be made general, but only apply
strictly to those who had acted
on the promise given, evidently a
middle course. The imperfect (gen-
erally conative) with a negative
usually has a force expressed in Eng-
lish by ⁶ would ’ or ‘ could ’; here it
means ⁶ was not disposed to‚’ and so
‘advised not to '; cf. decernente, 5.

8. merita, etc.: i.e. that it wasn’t
merely a matter of rewarding ser·
