[Boon 1.

Mirum quantum illi viro nuntianti haec fides

fuerit, quamque desiderium Romuli apud plebem exerci-
tumque facta fide immortalitatis lenitum sit.

Patrum interim animos certamen regni ac cupido

versabat.

Necdum ad singuIOS, quia nemo magnopere

eminebat in novo popu10, pervenerat: factionibus inter

ordines certabatur.

Oriundi ab Sabinis, ne, quia post

Tatii mortem ab sua parte non erat regnatum, in socie-
tate aequa possessionem imperii amitterent, sui corporis
creari regem volebant3 Romani veteres peregrinum

regem aspernabantur.

In variis voluntatibus regnari

tamen omnes volebant, libertatis dulcedine nondum ex-

perta.

the indirect discourse construction,
as a statement to be made (tradant
posteris); but it is preceded by ita
(not id), just as the wish above is
preceded by ita with velle.

8. mirum: sc. est, with the indi-
rect question for its subject.-—desi·

plebs, whose state of mind has

sentence by a change of voice.—
certamen: the immediate struggle
for the throne; cupido: more
general, something like ambition.
— pervenerat: sc. certamen (but
the reading is uncertain). —— fac·
tionibus, by saniores: the means
used by the two great tace-parties
(ordines) to secure the power
through their dependeuts and con·
nections.

Timor deinde patres incessit ne civitatem sine

2. sua: we should expect eorum ,-
but the thought is partially put into
the minds of the Sabines, yet not
sufficiently to change the mood of
the verb.— in societate aequa:
i.e. though in a partnership that
should be equal. The Latin aboundS,

interpreted by the context.

3. in variis, etc.: i.e. though
their views varied, yet all were
unanimous for a king (cf. last note) ;
the effect here is produced, how-
ever, by the emphatic position of
variis and regnari.— tamen: i.e.
notwithstanding the want of agree·
ment.

4. timor: as opposed to the de·

etc.: notice the Livian painting by
successive strokes: lest, the state*
being without a ruler, the army
without a leader, tltefielings 9ss etc.,
