unum locum se omnes inclinant.
ιο armisque rupere cuneo viam. Duxit via in editum le-
Inde primo restitere; mox, ut respirandi

niter collem.

Eo nisi corporibus

prope puberem aetate relictum, stirpem genti Fabiae

maximum futurum auxilium.

adverb, as often. — eo nisi‚fhrcing·
their way there (to that).—viam:
see Gr. 238 c.

10. inde: as their resistance was
directed forward from their stand-
point, Livy can say stom there where
we should say there. — vincebat .

citas», the sew,· a bold expression,
but used in the same manner as
multitudo and similar words in a
concrete sense.

11. praesidium:
camp they had erected3 cf. 49. 8.
—- puberem: he was consul ten
years later (B.c. 467), so that he must
have been a tolerably large boy at
the time. —aetatez it is difficult to
say whether Livy means to connect
this with puberem (cf. maior natu)
or with relictum. Historians vary

the sortified

in their statements as to whether
he was lefl at home or lest from
the slaughter, but Livy’s words seem
to indicate the latter, in which case
the word goes better with pube-
rem. — auxilium: eg Q. Fabius

Maximus and Fabius Cunctator. ·

Cf. Ov, F. ΙΙ. 239 seq.
