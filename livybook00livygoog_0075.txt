cum id perpetuumque sacerdotium fuit, deductus in
arcem, in lapide ad meridiem versus consedit. Augur 7
ad laevam eius capite velato sedem cepit, dextra manu
baculum sine nodo aduncum tenens, quem lituum appel-
larunt. Inde ubi prospectu in urbem agrumque capto
deos precatus regiones ab oriente ad occasum determi-
navit, dextras ad meridiem parteS, laevas ad septem-
trionem esse dixit, signum contra, quoad longissime s
conspectum oculi ferebant, animo finivit3 tum, lituo in
laevam manum translatO, dextra in caput Numae impo-
sita, precatus ita est: ‘Iuppiter pater, si est fas hunc 9
Numam Pompilium, cuius ego caput tene0, regem Romae
esse, uti tu signa nobis certa adclarassis inter eos fines
quos feci! Turn peregit verbis auspicia quae mitti
vellet ; quibus missis declaratus rex Numa de templo
descendit.

inde, etc.: Livy thinks of the public
institution of augury as only then
established, and the earlier practice
of it as a private proceeding, which,
of course, could hardly have been
true—honoris ergo: i.e. to give
dignity to the function. — per-
petuum, permanent ,· opposed to
the occasional exercise of the func-
tions. — arcem: apparently the
Capitoline Hill.

7. ad laevam: at his lest, and
probably so as to look towards the
south.—in urbem agrumque: if
the augur faced south, as is likely,
though not entirely clear from Livy’s
account, the city lay before him,
a little to the left, and his view ex-
tended over it and the adjoining
country (ager Romanus) beyond the
hills. —determinavitz i.e. drawing
a line through the heavens from
east to west, he arbitrarily deter-
mined what sights should be dextra
and what laeva.

cording to the side in which it
appeared. Livy doesn’t mention
the meridian line distinctly‚ but he
does not necessarily exclude it.

9. Romae: locative. — certa:
τῖε. about which there may be no
doubt.—adclarassis: an old form
and a technical word. The con·
struction is an old one of wishing
(Gr. 267 b). For the tense see
Gr. 267 a. —peregit‚ etc.: i.e. he
stated what phenomena‚ according
to the established ritual, would be a
sign of approval.—- templo: Livy
probably has in his mind a perma-
nent auguraculum or auguratorium
built later on the Capitoline; but
the word equally applies to any spot
