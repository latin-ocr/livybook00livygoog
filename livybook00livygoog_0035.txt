could.'—tantisper: i.e. ad pube·
rem 'aetatem3 the story doesn't
tell how long. -tutela muliebri:
i.e. strange as it may seem, explained
by tanta, etc. —tantaz τῖε. so great,
as is indicated by the facts which
are set forth3 a form of expression
common enough in all languages,
and particularly common with Livy3

cf. adeo, Pref 11. —- res: in its
. regbglar meaning of state, as in res
pu zca.

2. ambigam, discuss; properly,
question, implying that there was
doubt3 hence haud is more admis-
sible3 cf. haud dubito. —adfirmetz
see Gr. 268.—hicine: the collo-
quial old form of hic with the inter-
rogative -ne ,· see Gr. 100. ft.n.

fuerit, etc., whether it was this As-
canius. — maior, older. — quem:
sc. is, the predicate of fuerit.—
Iulum eundem, being the same as,
etc., in apposition with quem.—
nuneupat, claims,· a somewhat
formal legal word.

genitus: the later writers often
use relatives with a participle in this
manner. — abundante: emphasized
as the reason of the emigration.—-
multitudine: regularly of the un-
distinguished numbers of population
or followers3 cf. 1. 2 and 8.

florentem: and so not needing
a hero to foster it. — iam, getting to
be.—seu: often used, especially by
later writers, as an abbreviation for
two appositives with sive . . . sive,-
τῖε. Laviniae seu matri seu no-
vercae,· whether one or the other.
— sub, at the soot osi—porrectae:
cf. coalescentium, 2. 5 n. — Longa:
emphatic; cf. the same words again
in the next line. The whole tradition
is probably manufactured. It is diffi-
cult to see how any white town could
have been built in this position. The
word Alba is probably from some
pre-Latin language ; see Helbig
above cited on 1. 3.

4. Lavinium: sc. conditum, ob·
scurely implied in deductam.
