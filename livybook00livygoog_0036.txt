14 LIVY. [Boox 1.

triginta ferme interfuere anni. Tantum tamen opes cre-
⁸ verant maxime fusis EtrusciS, ut ne morte quidem Aeneae
nec deinde inter muliebrem tutelam rudimentumque
primum puerilis regni movere arma aut Mezentius Etrus-
5 cique aut ulli alii accolae ausi sint. Pax ita convenerat,
ut Etruscis Latinisque fluvius Albula, quem nunc Tibe-
6 rim vocant, finis esset. Silvius deinde regnat, Ascanii
7 filius, casu quodam in silvis natuS. Is Aeneam Silvium
creat, is deinde Latinum Silvium. Ab eo coloniae aliquot
8 deductae, Prisci Latini appellati. Mansit Silviis postea
omnibus cognomen qui Albae regnaverunt. Latino
Alba ortuS‚ Alba Atys, Atye CapyS, Capye CapetuS,

tamen: τῖε. notwithstanding the
shortness of the time.

fusis Etruscis: this gives a chief
reason for the rise in power.

morte: i.e. when there was no
king.

inter: often thus used of time
combined with circumstance or situ-

command or the like. Cf. Gr. 31 7. a.
—Etruscis: a free use of the dative
of reference. .

6. Silvius : this personage is made
by many the son of AEneas (cf.Aen.
VI. 763). The following reigns are
intercalated to fill up the gap of
three or four hundred years between

ation.

muliebrem: i.e. when there was
only a woman at the head of affairs.

rudimentum: not merely begin-
ning, but i nexperienced attempts.—
movere arma, make any hostile
demonstration.

Etruscique: cf. Turnus Rutu·
lique, 2. 3 n.

8ausi sint: for tense see Gr.
2 7. c.

5. pax: here Livy resumes again
the narrative interrupted‚ after the
battle in 2. 3, by tbe digression on
AEneas and his son. It is not un·
likely that Livy follows another
source here, combining two differ-
ent accounts. See note on Silvius
below,

ita, with the proviso ,· often a
clause which seems like a result
clause as defining a correlative,
is really a purpose clause express-
ing something which is originally a

the fall of Troy and the founding
of Rome (cf. 29. 6). The whole
dynasty seems purely mythical.

7. Prisci Latini: the meaning of
this expression is involved in doubt.
It seems to distinguish cities in
power before Alba became the head
of the Latin league. Livy is incon-
sistent with himself about them, as
¹s3.³?13.⁴’1.3⁹t}¹53⁶g31¹.{..¹.¹13}¹3³ ἐῗ. ῗιίἓ
38. 43 5²· 23 32. 11 and 14.—ap-
pellati: sc. sunt.

8. Silviis : the regular dative of
narneS. Cf. 1. 33 and see Gr. 231. b.
This was probably a real traditional
name at Alba.

cognomen: Silvius seems like a
gentile name (nomen), but proba·
bly was not felt by Livy as such.
Such names are all supposed to be
derived from the name of a founder,
which Silvius, as an adjective from
silva, is not felt to be.
