LIVY.

[Βοοκ 11.

bissimae ac crudelissimae in plebem Romanam exorsuS‚
ε curn a patribus non consulem sed carnificem ad vexan-
dam et lacerandam plebem creatum esse contenderet,
rudis in militari homine lingua non suppetebat libertati

9 animoque.

Itaque deficiente oratione ‘ Quando quidem

non facile loquor-⁹ inquit, ‘ QuiriteS, quam quod locutus

sum praest0‚ crastino die adeste.
ιο spectu vestro moriar, aut perferam legem.'

Ego hic aut in con-
Occupa-

bant tribuni templum postero die; consules nobilitasque

ad impediendam legem in contione consistunt.

Submo-

veri Laetorius iubet praeterquam qui suffragium ineant.

n Adulescentes nobiles stabant nihil cedentes viatori. Tum
ex his prendi quosdam Laetorius iubet.

Consul Ap-

pius negare ius esse tribuno in quemquam nisi in ple-

12 beium: non enim populi sed plebis eum magistratum

esse; nec illum ipsum submovere pro imperio posse

3, vetere atque insita Claudiae fiz-
miliae superbia—exorsus: as so
often, two statements in one sen·
tence. ⁶ While Volero confined him-
self to the law, Laetorius proceeded
to personalities, but having begun,
he found his eloquence unequal to
the subject, and so,’ etc.

8. rudis in, etc.: i.e. as would
be natural in a soldier. — libertati
animoque, llis independent spirit.

9. quarn: correlative with a tam
implied in non facile. — crastino:
the day of the comitia. — perfe-
ram ε of course this all looks towards
expected violence from the patri·
cians.

10. occupant: τῖε. take posses-
sion in advance of their opponents.
— templum z the tribunal, or raised
platform. -in contione: appar-
ently the first assembling of citizens
at a comitia was contio, in which
they were informed, by the presid-
ing magistrates, of the ‘object of

the meeting’ and the questions at
issue. This was dismissed by the
order discedite ad suffragium, upon
which the citizens took their respec-
tive places in order to vote.— sub·
moveri: the regular word for clear-
ing the way; here to be kept back
as outsiders from hindering the pro·
ceedings. So sar as Livy’s words
go, there is no indication that the
patricians claimed the right to vote.

n. stabant: i.e. they refused to
move.—viatori: the officer of the
tribunes, or of any magistrate. —
prendi: the usual practice os magis-
trates to enforce their orders. —
negare, etc.: apparently a new
claim testing on a quibble. Such
new or forced interpretations of
law are still common on occasions
of politica] excitement. There is
nothing like a party contest to prq-
duce ‘ implied powers ⁹ or ‘ strict con·
structions.'
