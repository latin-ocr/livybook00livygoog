que instandO, ut litterae sibi ad Tarquinios darentur:
4 nam aliter qui credituros eos non vana ab legatis super
rebus tantis adferri? 'Datae litterae, ut pignus fidei
5 essent, manifestum facinus fecerunt. Nam cum pridie
quam legati ad Tarquinios proficiscerentur cenatum forte
apud Vitellios esset, coniuratique ibi remotis arbitris
multa inter se de novo, ut fit, consilio egissent, sermo-
nem eorum ex servis unus excepit ; qui iam antea id
6 senserat agi; sed eam occasionem, ut litterae legatis
darentur, quae deprehensae rem coarguere possent, ex-
spectabat. Postquam datas sensit, rem ad consules detu-
7 lit. Consules ad deprehendendos legatos coniuratosque
profecti domo sine tumultu rem omnem oppressere, litte-
rarum in primis habita cura, ne interciderent. Prodito-
ribus extemplo in vincla coniectis de legatis paululum
addubitatum est, et quamquam visi sunt commisisse ut
hostium loco essent, ius tamen gentium valuit. ⁶

and the like.—litterae: i.e. from
the conspiratum, in order to com·

7. profecti, etc.: as magistrates
they had the power of proceeding

promise, and so bind them.

4. qui, how—credituros : see
Gr. 338. ’

5. proficiscerentur: see Gr. 327.
— arbitris, witnesses‚· the earlier
meaning. — ut fit, as was natural ,-
this idea is immediately connected
with novo, as it was because their
heads were full of the new plans
that they talked about them. —- qui,
ete.: translate with a new sentence,
‘hes' ete.

6. eam occasionem: i.e. the op-
portunity afforded by the giving of
the letter; hence the dependent
clause takes the form of a purpose
clause: he was waiting for the letter
to be delivered, to take advantage
of that opportunity. — detulitz the
technical word for laying definite in-
formation before the authorities,

immediately, without our machinery
of wan-ants», etc.—-sine tumultu:
i.e. without creating any alarm ot
stir outside of their own official cir·
cle. — oppressere, cruslzed: the
word properly means more than this.
They anticipated the outbreak by
putting their hand on it in its incep-
tion, caught it in the act and nipped
it in the bud, as it were; or, they
seized it by the throat3 hence lit-
terarum in primis, etc., in accord-
ance with the rest of the figure. —-
ne interciderent: a common form
of explanatory purpose clause, where
an object has already been expressed3
cf. 9. 5 and see Gr. 334. c. for a sim·
ilar usage in the indirect question.
-— ut hostium, etc.: i.e. had for-
feited the rights of ambassadors
(cf. ius gentium).
