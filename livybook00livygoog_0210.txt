LIVY.

[Boox 11.

Relata re ad senatum adeo fuit gratum patribus

ut et captivorum sex milia Latinis remitterent, et de
foedere, quod prope in perpetuum negatum fuerat, rem

6 ad novos magistratus reicerent.

Enimvero tum Latini

gaudere facto; pacis auctores in ingenti gloria esse.
Coronam auream Iovi donum in Capitolium mittunt.
Cum legatis donoque qui captivorum remissi ad suos

7 fuerant magna circumfusa multitudo venit.

Pergunt do-

mos eorum apud quem quisque servierant, gratias agunt
liberaliter habiti cultique in calamitate sua3 inde hospitia

iungunt.

Numquam alias ante publice privatimque La-

tinum nomen Romano imperio coniunctius fuit.

Sed et bellum Volscum imminebat et civitas secum
ipsa discors intestino inter patres plebemque flagrabat
2 odio, maxime propter nexos ob aes alienum. Freme-

5. relata: the technical term for
the act of the consuls consulting
the senate as to the proper course
of action; here deferre might be
used, but it would mean only re-
port, and not consult. —- fuit: sc.
the act of the Latius. —captivo-
rum: the taking of these captives
has not been mentioned, but what·
ever account Livy is following, the
events occurred just after the Latin
war, when the Romans might be
supposed to have had prisonem-
de foedere: this has not been men·
tioned, and Livy is evidently fol-
lowing another, but not necessarily
inconsistent account, as is seen by
servierant, 7. — fuerat: see Gr.
291. b. R.; the auxiliary is here used
with the classical force.— reicerent:
at first sight not a concession, but it
was something to allow the possi·
bility of aetion on that point.

6. enit-nvem, really, you may be
sure, or the like, the usual force of
the word, introducing an important
change iu the situation. —pacisz

indicating that there was another
party which favored war. — qui:
the antecedent is in apposition with
multitudo.

. 7. servierant: they had already
been sold as slaves, which would
agree with Livy’s story; perhaps
this is a part of his attempt to join
the two accounts, a function that he
often has to perform. — habiti, etc. ι
these words contain, in the form
of a predicate participle, the cause
of their gratitude.—hospitia: the
peculiar ancient relation of semi·
official friendship3 cf. Ι. 45. 2 n.

DISCONTENT oF THE PLEBS.

23. sed: in opposition to the
good fortune of the Latin allianee.
—bellumz not as opposed to the
Latin peace, which would be Vol-
scum bellum, but as opposed to the
domestic dist urbanceS. — flagrabat,
was ablaze, keeping the forcible fig-
ure. — nexost the cause was really
the state of things under which the
oppression took place, but it is po·
