terra sibi prolem ementiebantur, locum, qui nunc saeptus
descendentibus inter duos lucos est, asylum aperit. Eo 6
ex finitimis populis turba omnis sine discrimine, liber
an servus esset, avida novarum rerum perfugit, idque
primum ad coeptam magnitudinem roboris suit.

Cum iam virium haud paeniteret, consilium deinde 7
viribus parat: centum creat senatores, sive quia is
numerus satis erat, sive quia soli centum erant qui creari
patres possent. Patres certe ab honore patriciique pro·

’ genies eorum appellati.

cf. the example of Cadmus, Ov.
Met. 111. 105.—-saeptus, enclosed
for some purpose. —descendenti·
bus, as you go down. Gr. 235. b.
—lucosz the Capitoline Hill had
two summits, on each of which
seems to have been a sacred grove,
and between these a depression—
asylum: there were in Greece and
Italy many such places of refuge
(cf. Tac. Ann. ΙΙΙ. 60 seq.), to
which persons might flee and be
under the protection of the divinity.
This sanctity was often violated, but
was in the main respected. There
is no reason to believe that the
statement here is not true. The
growth of Rome seems to indicate
an influx of adventurers (avida
novarum rerum) who were at-
tracted by the sudden mercantile
importance of the city. It is more
probable‚ however, that the asylum
already existed than that it was
opened expressly3 cf. 30. 53
XXXV. 51. 2.

6. id: referring to the influit.—
ad, towards ‚· looking forward to the
size of the city as planned by
Romulus; cf. 4. -- roboris, real
strength ‚· partitive with id or pri·
mum, with both of which it properly
belongs, and having reference to
vana magnitudo above. „

7. iam: i.e. after the accessions.
— paeniteret, lead no reason to
be dissatified. — consilium, a

· head,· properly, wise counsel to

direct the powerful body3 but the
word is used in a half abstract and
half concrete sense as being the
regular name for any coumil, and
especially for the senate. -soli:
i.e. these were all the heads of
families that there were. —patresz
i.e. heads of old clans. It must be
remembered that the father, so long
as he lived, was the only free mem·
ber of a family, while all his de·
scendantS, however numerouS, were
in his power.—-certe: as opposed
to the doubt in sive . . . sive.

ab honore, as a distinction, as a
council of the elders: cf. senatus,
earl, alderman, and similar wordS.
This would agree with the first sup·
position tolerably well, but not at
all with the second, unless we
suppose the name to have become
accidentally attached to them, as
fathers par excellence. -patriciit
this part is no doubt true, as the
word is an adjective, like other
words in ·icius,· cf. Cic. de Rep. 11.
12. 23, Romuli senatus, qui constabat
ex optimatibus, quibus ipse rex tan·
tum tribuisset ut eos patres vellet no-
minari patriciosque eorum liberos.
