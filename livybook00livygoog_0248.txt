largitioni resistebat auctoribus patribus nec omni plebe
adversante, quae primo coeperat fastidire munus vul-
5 gatum; a civibus isse in socios; saepe deinde et Vergi-
nium consulem in contionibus velut vaticinantem audie·
bat pestilens collegae munus esse, agros illos servitutem
6 iis qui acceperint laturOS, regno viam fieri. Quid ita
enirn adsumi socios et nomen Latinum? Quid attinu-
isse HerniciS‚ paulo ante hostibu8‚ capti agri partem
tertiam reddi, nisi ut eae gentes pro Coriolano duce
7 Cassium habeant? Popularis iam esse dissuasor et in-
tercessor legis agrariae coeperat. Vterque deinde con-
sul certatim plebi indulgere. Verginius dicere passu·
rum se adsignari agros, dum ne cui nisi civi Romano
8 adsignentur3 CassiUS, quia in agraria largitione ambiti-
osus in socios eoque civibus vilior erat, ut alio munere
sibi reconciliaret civium animOS, iubere pro Siculo fru-

4. nec omni: i.e. no doubt some
rich plebeians were also interested
in the great bodies of public lands

by Cassius as a means to destroy the
liberty of the Romans.

7. popularis, etc.: τῖε. the oppo-

let for pasturage and the like. —
primo: opposed to deinde in 5. —
fastidire: see Gr. 333. b. — vulga·
tum: in the fact that the socii were
to enjoy it also. — socios: possibly
this part of the scheme is borrowed
by the ancient historians from the
later measures of Drusus.

5. et: as well as their dissatissac-
tion with the extent of the boon. —
vaticinantem: not merely ‘ prophe-
sying,' in our sense, — anybody can
do that,—but with the idea of an

—inspired foresight. — regno: the
suggestion of this bugbear was the
second cause of the alarm of the

lebs.

p 6. ita, in this way, as they were.
— adsumi: see Gr. 338. — attinu-
isse: i.e. ‘what did it mean?’ ‘why
should it be done? ’ — nisi ut, etc. :
asse. that these nations should be used

nent of these measures, ordinarily
favored by the plebs, had begun, by
these appeals to their prejudices, to
be regarded as the true friend of
the people. — dissuasor, opponent,
by argument ; intercessor, nulli-
fier, by the power of one colleague
to stay the other’s proceedings.—
uterque, etc.: i.e. it now became
a race sor popular favor between
the two consuls. —adsignari‚ etc. ε
thus catering to the prejudices of
those who wished to confine the
largess to Roman citizens. — ad-
signentur: see Gr. 314. a.

8. agraria: opposed to the lar-
gess of money.—ambitiosus: in
its regular meaning os catering to
one for political purposes. Of course
the point of view is a later one, as
the struggle for equality of the Lat-
ins could hardly have begun so early.
