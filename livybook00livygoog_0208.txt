which. — auctorum: ordinarily the
antiquity of the authorities would
be an assurance of correctness, but

’ there had been so many causes of

disturbance that Livy takes the view
of the date of the battle given in
chapter 19.

is not necessary to suppose that the
war was waged to restore the Tar-
quins, though this is stated by some
of the ancient authorities. They
might have fought on that side in
the hope of being restored, and
afterwards naturally fled to the next
uninjured neighbor.

6. luxuriosa, excessive, properly,
of a free and luxuriant growth.—-
inservitum: doubtless to secure
their continued devotion to the re-
public‚ which was after all only an
oligarchy. Of the three estates,
king, lords, and commons, the com·

mons usually hold the balance of
power, and are ‘ regularly used by
one of the first two to crush the
other.

7. Signia: cf.·1. 56. 3. We must
suppose the temnant of the colony
driven out and again sent back with
completed numbers—una et vi·
giuti: i.e. four in the city (cf. 1.
43. 13), sixteen outside (rusticae),
and the tribus Crustumina besides.
—aedes Mercuri: cf. 27. 5, where
the same thing seems to be repeated.
