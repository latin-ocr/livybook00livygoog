inhumanumque inde traditur scelus monumentoque locus
est: Sceleratum vicum vocant, quo amens agitantibus
furiis sororis ac viri Tullia per patris corpus carpentum
egisse fertur, partemque sanguinis ac caedis paternae
cruento vehiculo contaminata ipsa respersaque tulisse
ad penates suos virique sui, quibus iratis malo regni
principio similes prope diem exitus sequerentur..

s Servius Tullius regnavit annos quattuor et quadra·
ginta ita ut bono etiam moderatoque succedenti regi
difficilis aemulatio esset. Ceterum id quoque ad gloriam
accessit, quod cum illo simul iusta ac legitima regna

9 occiderunt. Id ipsum tam mite ac tam moderatum im-
perium tamen, quia unius esset, deponere eum in animo
habuisse quidam auctores sunt, ni scelus intestinum
liberandae patriae consilia agitanti intervenisset.

7. inde, thereupon, as osten. The
word really belongs to fizctum esse
or the like implied in traditur sce·
lus. - agitantibus, etc. z explain·
ing amena, in accordance with the

effective without being forced3 the ’
sanctity of the household hearth is
still more violated by the actual con-
tact of the crime.— quibus iratis,
from whose wrath. — malo, that

ancient idea of the F uries driving
to madness the guilty criminal‚ an
idea embodied in the actual pursuit
by these goddesses so often repre·
sented on the stage and in art.
Naturally such madness leads to
new crimes. —- sororis et viri: see
46. 7 n. The genitive is the regular
way of expressing the relation be·
tween the avenging deities and the
{fissssssgzxgssffegff :3232 ..ti-..22¹
facit per se ,· cf. ectenti above.—

aanguinis ac caedis paternae, the'

blood os her murdered ather. The
Latin can say, ‘the bood and (by
consequence) the murder of her
father‚’ a mixture of concrete and
abstract which would be harsh in
English. — contaminata, etc. ε a
chiastic reference to sanguinis and
caedis. — tulisse ε here the order is

ill-starred. — sequerentur: it is
unnecessary to go farther for the
subjunctive than the indirect dis-
course.

8. bono, etc.: the order makes
an argument a fortiori,—‘much
less to the king who did succeed.'
—iusta ac legitima: rather an
exaggeration‚ but the reign as ap·

roved by the people is regarded as
egitimate. From now on the rule
became a tyranny.

9. id ipsum, and even that.—
tamen: op d to the ‘ although '
implied in tffisssreceding adjectives.
—uniusz as op sed to the com·
monwealth. — n . . . intervenis·
set: apodosis to deposuisset implied
in in animo habuisse, etc„ a con-
struction quite admissible in English
as west—intestinum: i.e. in his
own family, opposed to patriae.
