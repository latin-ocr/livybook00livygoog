4¹· 4.-offerre se, to sace. —ho·
ntem: not merely a repetition of
ducis, etc., as an English pronoun
would be, but giving an additional
idea that they were so much im·
ressed that they stood by and
ooked on while an enemy was
laying waste their landa. — ea: sc.
praeda. —data est: cf. 42. 1 n.

3. praemio: the booty was a

rize or reward. —- parentem: as
vaed children; dominum: as op-
pressed slaves. Cf. the comparison
of Domitian and Trajan in Plin.
Pan. 2, non de domino sed de pa-
rente loquimur.

4. varia, etc.: i.e. though the
year was remarkable for the for·
tunes of war and the dissensions at
home, yet more than these the Pub·
lilian law makes it famous—vic·
toria, etc.: τῖε. as a triumph in the

contest more than for any perma-
nent advantage.

5. dignitatis, etc.: tle. the new
comitia lost dignity because the
most distinguished of the voters
were now excluded, and conse·
quently the body was only a hum-
ble assembly of the poorer classes,
Yet there is nothing in Livy’s words
that distinctly says that the patri·
cians were excluded from voting.
but only that they were excluded
from being present to hinder. See
note to 56. 10.
