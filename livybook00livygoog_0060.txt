LIVY. ⁹

[Boox Ι.

mana inclinatur acies fusaque est ad veterem portam

Palatii.

Romulus et ipse turba fugientium actuS, arma

4 ad caelum tollenS, ‘ Iuppiter, tuis ² inquit ‘iussus avibus

hic in Palatio prima urbi fundamenta leci.

Arcem iam

scelere emptam Sabini habent, inde huc armati superata

5 media valle tendunt.

At tu, pater deum hominumque,

hinc saltem arce hosteS, deme terrorem Romanis fugam-

6 que foedam siste.

Hic ego tibi templum Statori Iovi,

quod monumentum sit posteri‘s tua praesenti ope serva·

7 tam urbem esse, vove0.'

Haec precatuS, velut si sensisset

auditas preces, ‘ Hinc,¹ inquit ‘ Romani, Iuppiter optimus
maximus resistere atque iterare pugnam iubet.’ Restitere
· Romani tamquam caelesti voce iussi, ipse ad primores

Romulus provolat.

Mettius Curtius ab Sabinis princeps ab arce decu-
currerat et effusos egerat Romanos toto quantum foro

the narrative to describe the state
of affairs3 hut it is somewhat un·
natural to imitate the effect in Eng-
lish.

3. ad veterem, etc.: the Porta
Mugionis, in the Clivus Palatinus
on the northeastern slope of the
Palatine.

Tamna or Jumma STA‘roa.

Romulus: conceived as present
at the fight, but in the rear.

4. avibus: see 7. 1.

5. siste: in its causative sense;
hence Stator, the Stayer.

6. templum: the substructions
are now visible on the excavated
Palatine. — Statori x emphatic, with
direct reference to siste.-—prae·
senti, direct, of a divinity coming
in person, as opposed to indirect
means. — servatam esse: cf. ne
quid, etc„ 11. 7 n. Here the lesson
taught is one of fact. The whole
matter looks like an attempt to ex·

plain Stator, which is more likely
to mean ⁴ the one who sets upright' ;
cf. Στήσιος, Ὀρθῶσιος. This view
seems to shimmer through serva-
tam. Not much reliance is to be
placed on these etymological myths,
as it is their very nature to be false ς
at least, no one about which the
truth was known was ever found to
be sound.

7. sensisset, had an intima-
tion ,· the emphasis gives the sug-
gestion of a divine monition. —-
hinc: not merely ltere, but from
this point, as the aetion of resistere
would be in the opposite direction.
—restitere, did make a stand
(emphatic).—ad primores: tak-
ing the place of his fallen general.

8. princeps, in the fi·ont.—-ef-
fusos, in confusion (a kind of
predicate).—quantum: the ante·
cedent tantum would be accusative
of extent of space. — foro: with·
out in on account of τοῖος Gr.
