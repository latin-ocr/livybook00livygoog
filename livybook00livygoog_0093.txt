non rebantur ea lege ne innoxium quidem posse, curn
condemnassent, tum alter ex his ‘Publi Horati, tibi

perduellionem iudico’ inquit.

‘Lictor, conliga manus)

71

Accesserat lictor iniciebatque laqueum. Tum Horatius a
auctore Tullo, clemente legis interprete, ‘ Provoco ’ inquit.
Ita de provocatione certatum ad populum est.

Moti homines sunt in eo iudicio, maxime Publio 9
Horatio patre proclamante se filiam iure caesam iudi-
care, ni ita esset, patrio iure in filium animadversurum
fuisse. Orabat deinde ne -se, quem paulo ante cum
. egregia stirpe conspexissent, orbum liberis facerent.
-Inter haec senex iuvenem amplexuS, spolia Curiatiorum
fixa eo loco qui nunc pila Horatia appellatur ostentans,
‘ Huncine ¹ aiebat, ‘quem modo decoratum ovantemque
victoria incedentem vidistis, QuiriteS, eum sub furca
vinctum inter verbera et cruciatus videre potestiS, quod
vix Albanorum oculi tam deforme spectaculum ferre

7. non rebantur: cf. note to
Horatio above.
8. iniciebat, began ta, etc.; see
Gr. 277. c. — auctor-e, by the ad·
vice of —clemente, etc-2 this re-
mark seems to be added merely as
an explanation of the advice or
approva1, inasmuch as the law ex·
pressly provided for the appeal. The
accused might, however, be supposed
to be ignorant of the privilege, or
afraid to take advantage of it. —
de provocatione: τῖε. whether it
was justifiable or not3 in other
wordS, whether the condemned was
really guilty or not (cf. note to Ho-
ratio above). The magistrate acts
summarily exparte, and only' m case
of appeal is the case tried.— ad
populum = apud populum, the
more usual form.
9. moti, etc.: the emphasis may
be rendere’d by a great effect was pro·
duced, etc„ more than anythingp else

by, etc.—ni ita esset, is that were
not tlte case. For tense see Gr.
308. a.—patrio iure: the pater
familias had the right of life and
death over all who were in potestate
sua. — orabat deinde: as if it
were, then (changing his tone) ke
began to entreat.

10. eo loco: a spot in the Forum.
— pila τ apparently a trophy. —
huncine: see Gr. 100 soom.—
decoratum: explaining his point·
ing to the spolia, which Horatius
had just now worn. — eum: a repe-
tition of huncine. — sub furca:
used inexactly·for rhetorical effect,
and referring to the usual punish-
ment οἱ slaves. The instrument
consisted of two sticks coming to a

10

sharp angle, bound over the neck ·

of the culprit, to which his arms
were bound—videre: i.e. bear to

see—quod . . . spectaculum: see
Gr. 201. d. ι ·
