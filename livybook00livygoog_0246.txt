patria mortua essem. Sed ego nihil iarn pati, nec tibi
turpius quam mihi miserim, possum, nec, ut sum mi-
serrima, diu futura sum: de his videriS, quOS, si pergiS,

deinde ac liberi amplexi fletusque ab omni turba muli-
erum ortus et comploratio sui patriaeque fregere tandem
virum. Complexus inde suos dimittit; ipse retro ab
urbe castra movit. Abductis deinde legionibus, ex agro
Romano invidia rei oppressum perisse tradunt alii alio

usque ad senectutem vixisse eundem inveni03 refert
certe hanc saepe eum exacta aetate usurpasse vocem,
multo miserius seni exsilium esse. Non inviderunt laude
sua mulieribus viri Romani: adeo sine obtrectatione
gloriae alienae vivebatur. Monumento quoque quod
esset, templum Fortunae muliebri aedificatum dedica-
tumque est.

sed, etc.: for the moment she has
brought herself into prominence, and
this she now corrects. ego is op-
posed to his below.—- nihil . . . nec:
loose writing for nec . . . quidquam,
correlative with nec . . . sum be-
low, and followed by non turpius.
The case differs from the ordinary
nec . . . nec after a negative, in that
the two are not strictly correlative.
Veturia herself has reached the
height of wretchedness‚ and her
son’s further acts cannot increase
her misery, but only his disgrace;
but with the wife and children both
may be increased.

9. videris: cf. videritis, Ι. 58. 10.

10. suos: his family, taking the
gender from the two sons. —- alio:
one was by suicide—antiquissi-
mum: cf. veterrimos, 18. 5.

11. refert, etc.: this implies that
he continued to live in exile. —
certe: cf. 2n.—1aude: the regular
earlier Latin construction would be
laudi mulierum, but this construc-
tion becomes after Livy common,
and is probably an imitation of the
Greek (cf. φθονεῖν τινί τινος), though
a natural enough use of language.
— sua: allowed, instead of earum,
on account of the idea of peculiar
or special contained in it.

12. quoque: εἰ. as well as glory.
— templum: four miles out on the
Latin Way, where the meeting was
supposed to have taken place.—
rediere: Livy resumeS, perhaps
from other sources, his dry narra-
tive after the picturesque incident,
joining it on as well as he can.—
Aequi, etc.: cf. 39. 1.
