3 ficitur. Eam rem minus aegre quam dignum erat tulisse
Romulum ferunt, seu ob infidam societatem regni seu
quia haud iniuria caesum credebat. Itaque bello quidem
abstinuit ; ut tamen expiarentur legatorum iniuriae regis-
que caedes, foedus inter Romam Laviniumque urbes
renovatum est.

4 Et curn his quidem insperata pax erat: aliud multo
propius atque in ipsis prope portis bellum ortum. F ide-
nates nimis vicinas prope se convalescere opes rati,
priusquam tantum roboris esset quantum futurum ap-
parebat, occupant bellum facere. Iuventute armata
immissa vastatur agri quod inter urbem ac Fidenas est.

of Rome.
4. quidem: indicating a connec-

a meh, or in a riot. .

3. minus aegre, etc.: i.e. Rom-

should have been, being moved
either by distrust of his colleague
or by his sense of justice. — seu . . .

bello is afterwards to be treated
as a concession. Latin is full
of such formal pointers, which Eng-

expiarentur: the guilt on both
sides in its religious aspect is
eleansed by the religious act of
renewing the treaty (see citations
under sollemne, 2). There is un-
derlying the whole a reminiscence
of ’ an old religious connection of
all the peoples of the Latin tace,

they had no war, though they had ex·
pected oue, but from another quarter

so as to make with it a single idea.
5. laevam . . . dextra: from the
point of view of the army as it
marched somewhat southward de-
vastating the country along the
Tiber. They would thus find the
Tiber on their right hand, and they
turned easterly up the Anio towards
