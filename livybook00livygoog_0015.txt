tallize it is not easy to see. By no possibility could Lavinium
be derived from Lavinia, any more than Rome from Romulus.
It is possible, of course, that foreign settlers may have estab-
lished themselves there before the Tiber was opened, and after·
wards removed to the new entrepot. That around a growing
'city of the kind referred to ,a miscellaneous population of
adventurers and refugees should have gathered is what one
could expect from more modern examples. In time, after
wealth had accumulated, it would be natural that agriculture
should again become prominent, and thus give rise to the pre-
vailing agricultural character of Roman society. For it was
not by manufactures that Rome grew, but by the raw products
of the soil, for which she served as the great collector and
distributor. Again, at a later time, war became the prevailing
occupatiori of the Romans, and the world-conquest which they
effected began.

5.- Such, or something like it, must have been the nucleus
around which crystallized the great mass of fable which was
received as the history of Rome. The conflicts of the orders

tell with certainty the real character of patricians, clientS,
and plebs, and the relations in which they stood to each
other. The most probable supposition is that the plebs was
composed of alien residentS, attracted originally by commer-
cial activitieS, and afterwards established as landholders in the
state, but not of it. On no other supposition can the marked
differ-enee between them and the patricians on the one hand
and the clients on the other be satisfactorily explained. But
their true character, as well as the steps by which they gained a
foothold in the state, will probably ever be a mystery. Many
indications point to a conquest of the city at an early time by
ο its Etruscan neighborS, and a long occupatiori, from which the
Romans finally succeeded in freeing themselveS, living there·
after under an oligarchic republi0.

But such a history as this, even if Livy had known it, would
