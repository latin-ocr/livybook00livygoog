1. Facturusne operae pretium
sim (beginning a hexameter; not
usually an approved style3 see Quint.
IX. 4. 74, and cf. Tac. Ann. I. 1),
whether [shall accomplislc anything
worth while ,· i.e. worthy of recogni-
tion in proportion to the trouble.
Cf. Sen. de Ben. III. 23. 2 and V. 1. 2.
—facturus is emphatic as opposed
to the undertaking of the work. Cf.
operae pretium saciat, XXV. 30. 3,
operae pretia mereri, XXI. 43.
9, where the other words are the
emphatic ones.

a primordio urbis: opposed to
partial histories‚ such as were most
of those current. —- perscripserim:
Gr. 307. c. — satis, very well ,-
often so used with an expressed or
implied negative. —- sciam: early
and colloquial use of the present
instead of the imperfect subjunctive
in conditions really contrary to fact3
Gr. 308. e. — ausim: an early and
colloquial form 3 Gr. 128. e.

rem: i.e. eo modo gloriari. Livy
is deterred from boasting of what he
intends to do by the fact that such
boasts are old and common, and, he
implies, not always fulfilled. Cf.
opening of Book XXI.—dum . . .
credunt, where, etc.; almost equiv-
alent to a participial construction
(Gr. 290. c. N.).—novi semper,
etc.: the emphatic position of novi
and the interlocked position of sem·
per make the expression mean ‘ every
new writer that arises thinks‚' etc.;
cf. V. 42. 6, novae semper cladis,
and III. 66. 2.

rebus, in the facts, or matter ‚·
ate. the investigation side of history.
certius ε i.e. than their predecessors.
—seribendi, etc.: i.e. the rhetorical
side—rudem: as the taste of the
time changes, the old is considered
less cultivated and elegant. Cf.
