16 turn hostem offerri. Omnium illo die, qua plebis qua
patrum, eximia virtus fuit: Fabium nornen, Fabia gens
maxime enituit. Multis civilibus certaminibus infensos
plebis animos illa pugna sibi reconciliare statuunt.

the reading is not certain ; this
clause also is a kind of quotation.

here approaching its later sense of
even, though not losing its sense of
also: ‘they would do what they
had done before, and also (even)
something more.' — ancipiti, criti-
cal ,· the opportunity offered by the
dangerous crisis is meant.

3. pilis. etc.: the regular tactics
were to throw the javelins at the
first onset, and then to press for-

ward with the sword to close quar-
ters; but here the advance of the
Romans was so fierce (infestior, 2)
that steady aim was impossible, on
account of the haste (trepidatio-
