Tum ita factum accepimuS, nec ullius vetustior

foederis memoria est. Fetialis regem Tullum ita rogavit ε
‘ Iubesne me, rex, eum patre patrato populi Albani foedus
ferire ? ' Iubente rege, ‘ Sagmina' inquit ‘te‚ rex, pOSCO.’

Rex ait ‘ Puram tollit0.’

Fetialis ex arce graminis herbam

puram attulit, postea regem ita rogavit: ‘Rex, facisne
me tu regium nuntium populi Romani Quiritium, vasa
comitesque meos?’ Rex respondit: ‘Quod sine fraude

quial, like its use in Plautus, etc.—
cives: i.e. the three championS. —
cum bona pace, without demur,-
i.e. on the part of the subject nation.
- alia aliis: i.e. whatever the con·
ditions of the compact, the man·
ner of making it is the same.

4. ita, as follows. - ullius, etc.:
i.e. this is the earliest of which we
have any record. - fetialis ε a priest,
or one of a college of priests. who,
under the protection os religion, like
the Greek κῆρυξ, acted as the means
os communication between hostile
nations. It is doubtless from books
of ritual of such a college that Livy
or his authority gets the formulae here
given. The institution is evidently an
old Latin one, said to have come from
the AEquiculi (32. 5). — patre pa·
trato: by the account given here this
suncti mary would seem to have been
the spokesman and active celebrant
of the rites on behalf of the em-
bassy. There is nothing to indicate
that he was other than a filialis.
The function seems to have belonged
to the whole college, and to have
been performed by a temporary
chairrnan. The origin of the parti-
ciple is uncertaim perhaps it was
originally used of one not really the

father of the elan, but made so, -
iubente rege: i.e. saying iubeo in
answer to the question preceding. —
sagmina: evidently connected with
sancio (sac-men), as the means of
making sacred the proceedingS, like
the olive branch (ἱκετηρία) of the
Greeks, It seems to have been used
of a particular plant, but what one
is uncertain. A special virtue was
no doubt assigned to it, as often
to many other plants; but with
this sacred character is evidently
confounded a representative charac-
ter symbolic of the place of its
growth‚ the Capitoline Hill. -— pu·
ram, free from (irreligious) taint.
5. graminis herbam, a growing
plant of the sacred herb. — regium,
etc.: as much as os the king of the
Roman people, indicating with rit-
ual verbosity the official character
of the proceeding.—vasa (co-ordi-
nate with me), utem-ih: a word
derived from common use, like
‘traps ' or ‘ baggage,' referring
here to the silex, verbena, etc. —-
comites: there seem to have been
three in all, the pater patratus, the
verbenarius, and the original se·
tialis. —fraude‚ etc., barm to, etc.;
an earlier meaning of the word. —·
